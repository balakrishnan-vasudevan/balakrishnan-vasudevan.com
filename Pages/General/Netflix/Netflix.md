## Feedback for #1

- No directional leadership experience when it comes to incident management
- Systems design was not good, lacks technical depth


If you want Netflix to hire you and pay you over 600K, you should exhibit appropriate technical qualifications. They should be convinced that you are the person for the job.
In your current state, you are horribly below the mark in terms of technical skills.
System design - poor


1. Tech phone screen - tech focussed and focussed on incident management, shine what is your strongest tech
2. Onsite - 2 parts
    1. Systems Design, Bridge Building, Cultural
    2. Technical incident management, visual data interpretation, SRE culture


3 things to look for,

1. Curiosity - insatiable attitude
2. Distributed systems knowledge
3. String leadership

Critical thinking - show your opinions, be bold, have your own opinions

Systems design problem

1. reason through it
2. show tech depth
3. don’t be general
4. think of and answer “why it is there?”
5. Scalability
6. Vulnerabilities in the system
7. Seek clarification
