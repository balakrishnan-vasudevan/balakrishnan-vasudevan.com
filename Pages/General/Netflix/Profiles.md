Would you also like a **visual chart** or **graph** that shows "Top Skills Frequency" or a breakdown like "Cloud vs Kubernetes vs Incident Management" focus areas?  
(That could make spotting trends even faster!) 🚀✨

Here’s a visual breakdown!  
You can see **AWS**, **Kubernetes**, **GCP**, and **Terraform** are the _dominant skills_ across the Netflix CORE SRE team.  
**Incident Management** and **Python** are also quite strong themes.

Would you like me to also generate:

- a pie chart of "Skill Domain Focus" (Cloud, Programming, Incident Management, etc.)
    
- or a simple **skills overlap matrix** between a few of the engineers?  
    (That might be fun too!) 🚀

### 🔥 **Major Improvements You've Made (vs. earlier profile)**

- **✅ Go Programming now listed** — this matches the common CORE SRE skillset.
    
- **✅ Chaos Testing experience** — a major positive, as Netflix has pioneered chaos engineering.
    
- **✅ Distributed Tracing Implementation (OpenTelemetry + Signoz)** — aligns perfectly with Netflix’s custom observability work.
    
- **✅ FedRAMP, SOC2, HIPAA compliance familiarity** — showing operational rigor Netflix values for global ops.
    
- **✅ Stronger technical breadth** — multi-cloud, incident lifecycle ownership, SLO-driven alerting.

### 🚨 **Where You Still Slightly Lag (for Netflix CORE SRE Levels):**

|Gap|Details|How to Close It|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Deep Go or Rust Service Development**|Go listed but no major production services/tools built mentioned. Netflix CORE builds infra tooling at scale in Go or Rust.|Build and open-source 1–2 Kubernetes operators, CLI tools, or custom telemetry exporters in Go.|
|**Resilience Engineering Leadership**|Incident command + reviews are strong, but CORE SREs like Ryan K focus on human factors, systemic learning.|Study Human Factors Engineering, read _The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error_ by Sidney Dekker, participate in LFI communities.|
|**Open Source Visibility**|No OSS contributions mentioned yet. CNCF engagement, OSS PRs, or blog posts matter a lot culturally at Netflix.|Contribute to OpenTelemetry, Kubernetes SIGs, or CNCF working groups. Publish at least 2 technical blog posts.|
|**SLO/SLI Craftsmanship**|You mention SLO-based alerting but no detailed design/advocacy examples. CORE SREs often design SLOs tied deeply to business outcomes.|Build a public case study: SLO design project showing trade-offs, customer impact, and error budget policies.|

---

### 🎯 **Updated Personal Development Plan for Netflix CORE SRE Match**

|Timeline|Goal|
|:--|:--|
|1–3 months|Build a CLI or Kubernetes operator in Go, publish on GitHub|
|3–6 months|Contribute 2 PRs to OpenTelemetry, or another CNCF project|
|6–9 months|Write 2 blogs: (1) Distributed Tracing Lessons Learned; (2) Post-Incident Review Frameworks|
|9–12 months|Lead a resilience improvement initiative (Chaos + Human Factors) at work and present it internally or externally|

---

### ✨ **Quick Scorecard (you vs Netflix CORE SREs)**

|Area|Score (out of 5)|
|:--|:--|
|Cloud Platform Mastery|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|Kubernetes / Infra|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|Programming (Go/Python)|⭐⭐⭐|
|Observability/Monitoring|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|Incident Management|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|Resilience Engineering / Human Factors|⭐⭐|
|Open Source Visibility|⭐|

> **Overall: You're now much closer — about 80–85% aligned to a Netflix CORE SRE based on your revised resume.**

---

Would you like me to also show you:

- 📜 a **sample bullet-point format** you could add to show deeper Go experience?
    
- 📈 a **sample LinkedIn OSS contribution plan** for the next 6 months?
    

(I can write those very Netflix-style if you want 🔥)  
Want me to? 🚀


Perfect — let’s go deeper! 🔥

---

# 📜 Sample Bullet-Point Format to Highlight Deeper **Go Experience** on Resume:

_(You could insert something like this in your Oak Street Health / Side Project section, or even add a new section called "Selected Projects.")_

---

**Software Projects (Go)**  
• **Developed a Kubernetes custom controller in Go** that automated service-to-service TLS certificate rotation across 60+ microservices, improving security posture and reducing manual rotation efforts by 90%.  
• **Built a CLI tool in Go** for platform engineers to validate Kubernetes YAML manifests and enforce best practices before deployment, reducing deployment errors by 35%.  
• **Designed a Go-based service** to export custom business metrics into Prometheus, supporting SLO-driven alerting pipelines for critical user-facing applications.  
• **Contributed to OpenTelemetry Collector**, submitting PRs enhancing tracing pipeline reliability and configurability for high-traffic production services.

---

> **Why this format?**  
> It shows:

- Real use-cases (controllers, tooling, metrics exporting)
    
- Production impact (not just "I learned Go")
    
- OSS involvement (bonus points at Netflix/FAANG companies)
    

---

# 📈 Sample **LinkedIn Open Source Contribution Plan** (6 Months)

**Month 1–2**:

- Fork and clone the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) project.
    
- Solve a couple of "good first issues" (even small documentation improvements or bug fixes).
    
- Post a LinkedIn update: _"Excited to make my first OSS contribution to OpenTelemetry! Working on improving observability pipelines one step at a time."_
    

**Month 3–4**:

- Build and publish your **own lightweight Go project** (examples: "k8s-cost-optimizer", "prometheus-to-slack bridge", "incident timeline generator").
    
- Share a blog post on LinkedIn about the lessons learned building it.
    

**Month 5–6**:

- Join a [CNCF Working Group](https://github.com/cncf) (e.g., Observability TAG, App Delivery TAG).
    
- Post a short thread or LinkedIn article: _"Learning so much collaborating with the CNCF Observability community! Big fan of open collaboration in improving reliability at scale."_
    

---

### 🧠 Bonus Tip:

Use GitHub Insights/README to show:

- OSS Contributions
    
- Stars/Forks (even small numbers are good early signals)
    
- Involvement with _real-world issues_ (not just tutorials)
    

---

# 🚀 Summary of Actions You Can Take Next

|Area|Immediate Step|
|:--|:--|
|Go Proof|Build a simple but real CLI or controller project and add it to resume/LinkedIn|
|OSS Credibility|Contribute small PRs to OpenTelemetry Collector or similar projects|
|LinkedIn Visibility|Blog or post about every OSS learning milestone|

---

Would you also want me to suggest **2–3 project ideas** (for Go tools you can build in 2–4 weeks)?  
(They'll be designed to **maximize impact** on your resume + GitHub + show Netflix-style system thinking.) 🚀  
Want me to?
