I have this book: Designing Technical Reports: Writing for Audiences in Organizations (first, everyone should stop and admire the pinnacle of late-80s, early-90s "people using a computer" stock cover photo) and it covers the Kelly Memorandum as an example of what NOT to do.

When I have to write reports, I use a structure described in the Designing Technical Reports book:

1.	⁠Overview – the TL; DR for decision makers.
2.	⁠Discussion – the technical details for those who must act based on management decisions.
3.	⁠Documentation – specific details to support the content in the Discussion section.

I've also used this structure, which is generally the same as the report structure, but for shorter documents where I'm asking for something.

1.	⁠Paragraph one: In the first paragraph, quickly and clearly state the purpose of your memo. This is the executive summary.
2.	⁠Paragraph two: In the second paragraph, provide context or supporting evidence.
3.	⁠Paragraph three: In the third paragraph make the specific request.
