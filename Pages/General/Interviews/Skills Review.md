## ‚úÖ TL;DR Summary

You are already **exceptionally well-aligned** with the vast majority of both **minimum and preferred qualifications** for top-tier SRE roles.

Your only potential differentiators to work on:

- Deepen or better highlight experience with **service mesh**.
    
- Emphasize structured **SLI/SLO/error budget work**.
    
- Explicitly state any **compliance/regulated env experience**.
    
- Share or develop a **public technical presence** (GitHub/blogs).
    
- Optional: pursue an **additional cert** if targeting specific companies.
