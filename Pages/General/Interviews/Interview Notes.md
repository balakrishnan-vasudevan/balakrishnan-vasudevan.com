The interview question that trips up even senior engineers:

Tell me about a challenging project.

Here's the framework that transformed my client's interview performance:

When your mind goes blank from nervousness, don't panic. Use the IAS method:

Impact: Start with what was at stake for the business. 
Approach: Explain your unique technical strategy. 
Scaling: Show how your solution handles growth.

Example: Instead of rambling about technical details, say:

"Our payment system was failing during traffic spikes, costing $50K daily. I identified a database bottleneck, implemented connection pooling and caching, then verified it could handle 10x our peak load."

This approach helped a senior engineer I mentored land offers at both Google and Microsoft after being rejected twice before.

The difference?

She stopped explaining every technical detail and started highlighting business impact first.

Your technical skills get you interviews. Clear communication gets you offers.

Interviews are not an easy thing to handle.  
Especially when your future is on the line.  
  
That feeling when your mind goes blank in an interview?  
  
Every great engineer has been there.  
Including me.  
  
After coaching hundreds of senior engineers through tech interviews, I've found that even the most brilliant minds freeze under pressure.  
  
The solution isn't memorizing more algorithms. It's having a framework that works under stress.  
  
Here's the system that transforms interview performance:  
  
Prepare for the silence.  
When faced with a challenging question, don't rush to answer.  
Say: "That's an interesting problem. Let me think about it for a moment." This gives your brain the space it needs.  
  
Externalize your thinking.  
Use the whiteboard or paper not just for code, but for your actual thought process. This reduces cognitive load and shows interviewers how you approach problems.  
  
Start with what you know. Begin with the simplest solution, even if it's inefficient. Say: "Let me start with a basic approach we can optimize." This builds momentum and confidence.  
  
Remember,  
  
The 1% engineers aren't those who never get nervous.  
  
They're the ones who know how to perform despite it.
