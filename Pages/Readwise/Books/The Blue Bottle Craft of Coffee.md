## Highlights
- The two main types of coffee that are harvested for consumption are arabica, from the species Coffea arabica, and robusta, from the species Coffea canephora (formerly known as Coffea robusta). Arabica, which is of much higher quality than robusta, accounts for around 70 percent of the coffee grown worldwide, and those of us in specialty coffee work almost exclusively with it. At Blue Bottle, the only exception are a few robustas—principally certified organic robustas from India and Madagascar—that we use to add depth and an oily body to one espresso blend. So I’ll focus on arabica here. ([Location 233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=233))
- Within this species, there are thousands of varieties—called varietals in the coffee trade. Typica and Bourbon are two of the most widely grown varietals. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=239))
- The ideal growing conditions for arabica coffee are a constant moderate temperature, a latitude between approximately 10 degrees north and south of the equator, and an altitude approximately 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet (915 m to 1,830 m), though coffee is grown successfully at lower altitudes. The higher the coffee is grown, the more slowly it develops and the denser the beans become, which can create more interesting flavors. Much like wine grapes grown under “stressful” conditions in great growing regions, the challenge of altitude forces coffee plants to focus their energy on developing seeds, rather than more extensive vegetative growth, which would be the plant’s inclination under less stressful circumstances. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=247))
- Depending on climate and elevation, coffee might be grown under shade trees, which can protect both the coffee plants and the native bird species, explaining the origin of the term shade-grown. However, coffee is also traditionally grown without shade in Brazil and in places with a lot of natural rainfall, such as Hawaii. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=254))
- The two main processing styles used in the coffee industry are washed, also called wet, and natural, also called dry. Washed beans are washed or soaked in water to remove the outer pulp before drying, whereas natural processing means the beans remain in the cherry for drying. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=274))
- Washing, or wet processing, results in coffees with higher acidity and more consistency, and these are among the reasons why this is the most common processing method. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=282))
- Kenya-style processing is similar to wet processing, with a longer fermentation period—often with an additional rinsing and soaking period that results in coffees with high acidity and elegance. The cherries are pulped and then fermented for eight to sixteen hours. Next, the beans are washed, then soaked in clean water, usually for six to twelve hours, but sometimes as long as forty-eight hours. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=289))
- Natural processing, or dry processing, is the original way of processing coffee. In this method, coffee cherries are dried whole on raised beds, mats, or patios. Some farms in Brazil let the coffee cherries dry on the tree and then harvest them when they resemble small prunes. Because the beans remain inside the fruit as it dries, this results in a very noticeable difference in aroma and flavor. For example, this is how Ethiopian natural coffees develop the fruity flavors and blueberry scents they are known for. Natural processing also results in coffee with more body and less acidity. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=292))
- This method does not come without risks. If the beans rest in the wet fruit for too long, the fruit will ferment and get moldy or impart a sour, yeasty taste to the coffee, so frequent raking is necessary during the drying period, which usually lasts around three weeks. The beans are then either stored in their skins for a period of months or hulled right away in a machine or by hand to remove the dried outer skin and the inner parchment. Natural coffee is a somewhat controversial topic in today’s coffee world. Some coffee professionals claim that natural processing is wrong because it allows reabsorption of some of the coffee fruit into the coffee seed, creating a characteristic fruit bomb flavor profile that can either hide subtle faults or obscure subtle virtues. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=296))
- PULPED NATURAL COFFEE Popular in Brazil, pulped natural processing is a cross between wet and dry processing. It is also known as honey processing, the word honey referring to the sweet pulp. As in wet processing, the cherries are pulped, removing the outer skin but leaving the mucilage attached to the beans. But then instead of soaking, the beans are spread on large tables to dry for anywhere from five days to two weeks, with the mucilage still surrounding them. The resulting coffees are more consistent in quality than dry-processed coffees and tend to have similar characteristics, such as a lot of body and low acidity. However, they don’t develop vivid fruit notes of dry-processed coffees. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=304))
- WET HULLING Wet hulling is a version of pulped natural processing used widely used in Sumatra, where it is called giling basah. It results in coffees with heavy body and low acidity. The process starts like pulped natural processing, except the coffee is only dried for about a day with the mucilage attached. Next, the beans are washed, partially dried again, and then hulled to remove the parchment before the beans finish drying. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=310))
- The main reason we blend is to achieve a consistently delicious flavor. The first blend was probably Mocha-Java, in which a winey, bright coffee from Yemen (which at the time shipped from the Red Sea port of Al-Makha, or Mocha) was added to the heavy, thick coffees being shipped out of Dutch coffee holdings in Java. As commercial coffee roasters came on the scene, their desire to create proprietary blends that would taste the same throughout the year led to more focus on blends than on the origins of the green coffee itself. This allowed coffee companies to “cheat” and increase their margins by sneaking in cheaper, lesser-quality coffees and hoping to cover them up with careful blending. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=326))
- The focus on single-origins is valuable and timely. These days we have a lot more access to quality lots of single-origin coffees that should be showcased on their own. There are some coffees that are so distinct, so brilliant, and so inspiring that they absolutely need to display their qualities unmediated by the influence of other coffees. Single-origin coffees also allow the efforts of the farmer to be better noted and rewarded. All of that said, there is definitely a place for blending: to make coffee drinkers happy by giving them a specific, repeatable experience tailored for a particular and enduring context. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=357))
- Some of Ethiopia’s best-known coffees are named for the region they come from, such as Yirgacheffe in Sidamo, which gets its distinctive floral notes from the coffee varietals, terroir, and traditional wet processing, and Harrar, which is dry processed and tends to have distinctive, bright fruit flavors. ([Location 370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=370))
- ETHIOPIAN CUP CHARACTERISTICS There’s a lot of dry processing in Ethiopian, which yields the classic blueberry profile, both in nose and in the cup, that Ethiopian coffees are known for. Even the wet-processed coffees can have amazing, delicate flavors, such as jasmine and stone fruit, with baking spices. However, the flavor of these wet-processed coffees is more subtle, and it’s easier to roast out some of the more delicate qualities. VARIETALS: Because of the huge number of coffee varietals in Ethiopia, the country has a numerical system in which the type of bean is referred to by a number, rather than a name of the varietal, as is the case in other countries. However, there may be several varietals present in any given bag of Ethiopian coffee, even one labeled single-origin. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=388))
- The word acidity is a wedge that can separate coffee professionals from their customers. As coffee professionals, we need to use this word a lot, but we try to use it internally. When customers hear or use that word, it’s typically as a pejorative. They hear acidity and think, “My tummy hurts!” They think about sharp, unpleasant flavors that actually aren’t directly related to the pH level of the coffee; rather, they’re related to compounds that develop as a result of poor brewing, holding coffee for a long time, or careless roasting of poor-quality green coffee. At Blue Bottle, when we speak to customers about acidity, we try to use words like bright, snappy, or lively. Technically, when coffee professionals use the word acidity, we aren’t talking about the pH level, but the presence of particular acids that are the same as those in lemons, berries, vinegars, and other “lively” foods. All of that said, coffee professionals generally revere these compounds more than most of our customers do, so we have to be careful that we don’t let acidity become the primary driver in our decision to buy a coffee. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=396))
- So much of the style and character of Brazilian coffee is about its processing—the pulped natural method that’s native to Brazil. Because of the large scale of production, reliable weather, and lack of shade canopy, in the early days most Brazilian coffee was dry processed, and there is still a lot of dry processing in Brazil. But pulped natural processing has been an important part of Brazil’s relationship with espresso, which came into fashion in Italy in the postwar years, when all the country had access to was low-grade dry-processed Brazilian coffee and rubbery-tasting robusta from North Africa. The pulped natural process turned out to be a preferable form of processing because it tends to create a heavier body and to mute acidity, adding a sweetness and refinement typically not present in dry-processed Brazilian coffees. In the 1980s, spurred on by large companies like Illy, even more coffee farms began to use pulped natural processing to get a more consistent product geared toward espresso extraction. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=416))
- BRAZILIAN CUP CHARACTERISTICS The majority of Brazilian coffee is grown at 1,800 to 4,000 feet (550 to 1,220 m). As a result, Brazilian coffee tends to have a softer, more muted flavor than those grown at higher elevations, and this quality is heightened by natural and pulped natural processing. It has a lovely, round, gentle quality and is rarely strident. It has sweetness—molasses and sugary tones—without many fruity notes. Good Brazilian coffee is comforting, likable, and seldom polarizing. VARIETALS: In addition to classic varietals, such as Bourbon and Typica, Brazilian hybrids include Icatu, which tends to have low acidity and chocolate flavors; Mundo Novo, which is sweet and has high yields; and Catuaí, which has a brighter flavor. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=431))
- EL SALVADORAN CUP CHARACTERISTICS What I love about great coffees from El Salvador is the way their complexity and sweetness is meshed with a heavy, silky body. Blue Bottle is lucky to be able to obtain a small amount of a beautiful coffee from El Majahual, in the Los Naranjos region in El Salvador, managed by Aida Batlle. It tends to have has notes of brown sugar and sometimes plum, butter, and toffee—a complex cup that’s tangy and has a long molasses finish. When we’re at the farm at the right time, we can often get El Majahual beans in as many as four different processing types: washed, dried, pulped natural, and the variation of the wet-hulling process Aida calls “Sumalvador.” VARIETALS: Key varietals grown in El Salvador are Bourbon, Typica, and Pacas. Pacas is a Bourbon mutation that has a bright flavor with floral characteristics and a heavy body. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=458))
- During roasting, the heat dries out the beans and converts starches into sugars. Although this process is usually referred to as either the Maillard reaction or caramelization, interchangeably, the two are really quite different. The Maillard reaction is the type of reaction that causes meat to brown or colors the crust on bread. It involves a reaction between sugar molecules and amino acids and produces more savory umami flavors than sweetness. Caramelization occurs at higher temperatures than the Maillard reaction and involves only sugar molecules. Paradoxically, increased caramelization results in decreasing sweetness but increasing complexity. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=693))
- In terms of coffee roasting, we’re hoping to hit that spot where the coffee will still be sweet but with a pleasantly savory and bitter complexity starting to develop. Undershooting that point by a little will result in coffee that’s bland but sweet. Undershooting it even more allows astringent, sour, grassy notes to remain, a quality coffee professionals refer to as underdeveloped. Overshooting the spot we are aiming at emphasizes the toastiness of the coffee flavors, much the same way that slightly too much time in the toaster makes the character of different types of bread hard to distinguish from each other. Even more time in the roaster will emphasize the carbon flavors of coffee, like the way the char of burned steak overpowers the taste of the meat inside. The important thing to remember is that the roaster chooses this optimum point of flavor development. It isn’t an objective decision, despite the school of thought that there are intrinsic qualities locked in coffee that roasters merely illuminate—that we are blessed with a privileged insight into some truth of coffee that others can’t hope to understand—like David somehow locked in that piece of marble, and Michelangelo chipping away to find him.

- Earlier in the day, the drop temperature—the internal temperature of the roaster when you drop the coffee into the drum—will be a little higher than later in the day because of the lower air temperature in the warehouse in the morning and the huge thermal mass of the roaster itself. If the drop temp is too high, you’ll scorch the beans when they are in a very vulnerable position—at cool room temperature and holding their maximum water content. Scorching robs the coffee of some of its vitality and thins the texture, so a drop temp that’s too high is a bummer. But if the drop temp is too low, that’s bad too. It can slow the roast to the point of flattening the flavor. In effect, the coffee bakes and steams in a humid environment, rather than roasting. For every varietal, you want to find the drop temp that enhances the qualities that make that particular coffee special. For example, altitude can correlate with density, and denser, high-elevation coffees, say from Ethiopia, often taste better when roasted with a higher drop temperature. On the other hand, a lower-elevation coffee from Brazil can’t take as much heat, so you would drop the Brazil at a lower temperature than the Ethiopian. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=774))
- Once the beans are loaded, you’re waiting for the roaster temperature to bottom out, indicating completion of the first stage of the roast. The green coffee is at about the ambient temperature of the warehouse, usually around 60°F (16°C) in our unheated Oakland space. So the thermal mass of the coffee brings the much greater thermal mass of the roaster down from about 380°F (193°C) to its lowest point—usually 180°F to 190°F (82°C to 88°C), depending on the weather and batch size. The amount of time it takes to get to the lowest point tells you how much energy you’ll need to put back into the coffee to get it though the roast. If you reach the lowest point at 2½ minutes, that’s a gentler curve than 1½ minutes, which means that you are in danger of baking instead of roasting. You write down the time when the temperature bottomed out. (The key to being a good roaster is systematically doing three things: taking good notes, cupping your coffee, and cleaning your machine.) Once the bean temperature hits the bottom of the curve, it’s going to climb, and your job is to keep it from climbing too fast. If you put too much heat into it, that will suck air through the drum, drying the coffee too quickly. You want the temperature to rise smoothly and gradually to get to what’s called first crack. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=792))
- First crack is the coffee roaster’s term for a chemical reaction that occurs as coffee begins to reach the “drinkable” stage. Much like the chemical reaction that pops corn, the audible popping, increase in bean size, and decrease in bean density that occurs in coffee at that stage of the roast is the result of the moisture trapped in the coffee boiling off and forcing its way outside the coffee bean, rupturing the cell walls. ([Location 803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=803))
- Because the coffee is steaming and losing water, it’s important to make sure that air is moving through the drum, otherwise the humidity level in the drum can get too high. About 5 minutes into the roast, the coffee starts to turn yellow-gold. With some coffees, this is when you first smell attributes that you want to be able to taste in the finished product. At this point, you might pull the tryer, which allows you to get a sample of the beans inside the roaster, and smell them—just out of sheer pleasure, because it smells like something great is about to happen. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=810))
- First crack is an endothermic reaction, which means that it depends on the coffee absorbing heat, so you have to make sure you’re still adding heat to the system. On the machines at our roasteries, with most of our coffees first crack happens at around 9 to 11 minutes in. If you’ve been careful, the beginning of first crack comes on subtly: a gentle pop or two, then nothing for a few seconds, then a few more pops—more often, louder, and more insistent. Right around first crack is when the creativity of the roaster starts to matter. You start pulling the tryer more often, and you think about the profile you’re aiming for and the last time you cupped this coffee. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=817))
- The short period of time before, during, and after first crack—approximately 120 seconds total—is when we are most consumed with changes in roasting variables. We want the temperature of the coffee to continue to rise, but we want to manage the rate very carefully. If the temperature rises too quickly, momentum will carry the coffee past where we want it to be. But if there isn’t enough heat, the temperature will stay the same for too long or, worse, fall, either of which can result in a coffee with a flat, boring flavor. At the beginning of the roast, we may allow the temperature to climb by 5°F (2.7°C) in 20 seconds, but toward the end we may tease the heat so that we add 5°F (2.7°C) over the course of 90 seconds, while still ensuring that the heat rises steadily, without stalling or… ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=823))
- Second crack is the coffee roaster’s term for the exothermic chemical reaction that occurs after first crack. As opposed to first crack, second crack produces its own heat, which can quickly sweep a roast past the point of being too dark. Any coffee labeled “French” or “Italian” roast is coffee that has most likely been roasted well into second crack. Depending on the type and quality of the green beans and the skill of the roaster, the coffee tastes more of toast, and perhaps carbon, than of its origin. Having said that, a generically “toasty” flavor profile is the object of a legitimate… ([Location 831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=831))
- The momentum of the heat in the beans means you can’t just set a target final temperature. You must account for the thermal mass and its momentum in deciding when to dump the batch. You have to bring maximum concentration to the task during the last 20 seconds of the roast, remaining alert to all of the sensory information that will inform your decision. You’re looking for signs that the beans are plumped up, and beautiful aromas that remind you of the last… ([Location 838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=838))
- You dump the coffee, then click on the fan and agitator arm to speed the cooling of the coffee. You open the door and there’s a puff of smoke. You feel the heat on your face. How the coffee looks and smells tells you a lot about whether the roast turned out how you’d hoped. The smell is the first cue: Did you nail it? If it smells like toast wafting down the hallway while you’re still lying snug and warm in bed, mingled with the dregs of the glass of strawberry Quik you left on the bedside table the night before, the answer is a most emphatic yes. If you get a stronger scent of toast mingled with the pungent smell of inflatable pool toys on a hot day, or the briny hit of opening a can of low-end olives at a smoky party you probably don’t want to be at in the first place, then you know you didn’t… ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=844))
- As the agitator arm spins the beans around to cool them, the temperature near the roaster rises. You can feel the heat on your face as you walk around the roaster. The fan sounds different because the bearings are under less pressure and it changes the sound in the room. As we’ve discussed, the sonic environment is an important part of the roaster’s sensory world. When the bearings sing a different song—a song that is about there being… ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=851))
- Because roasting cooks out some of the water in the coffee, each batch loses about 13 to 18 percent of its weight. To determine the water loss for each batch, you subtract the roasted weight from the unroasted weight and divide that number by the unroasted weight. That’s your percentage, and you write it down. Is it 14 percent or 14.5 percent? And if it was 14.8 percent yesterday, why is it different today? You keep track of all these numbers—the drop temp, the time to… ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=856))
- As a coffee roaster, your life is divided in roughly 17-minute segments—enough time to load the green coffee, roast it, dump it, cool it, and send it on its way. That means you have about twenty-five chances in an average day, 125 chances in a week, and 6,500 chances a year to make something beautiful. ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=875))
- Coffee has a life span: after being roasted, it gets more interesting for up to nine days after roasting—fuller, more complex, and generally more enjoyable. After that time, there’s an inevitable decline. Coffee oxidizes. The flavors become less vibrant, and eventually the coffee tastes dull. It’s stale. There’s really nothing you can do about it. Darker roasts are more perishable. Those tend to have a palpable decline within seven days after being roasted. Lighter roasts take longer to get to their peak and to become stale, especially light roasts of dense, well-harvested, well-processed, high-elevation coffee. We like to sell coffee to our customers no later than forty-eight hours after roasting. That way our customers have the amazing opportunity to participate in the life span of their coffee, experiencing it ascending to its peak and discovering when it starts to decline. Ground coffee is even more fragile. Espresso dulls ninety seconds after being ground. Courser grinds last a little longer: twenty minutes to an hour. That’s why Blue Bottle doesn’t sell preground coffee. ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=883))
- When you’re first starting, it helps to have a reference color in mind. When I started roasting coffee at home, I kept a handful of roasted coffee beans in a white ceramic bowl and compared the color of the coffee on the baking sheet to that in the bowl. Right away, I learned that the coffee continues to darken a bit after removing it from the oven, so when the coffee wasn’t quite as dark as my sample, I pulled the baking sheet out of the oven. After a while roasting the same varietal, you’ll get a sense of what color translates to what flavor. One thing to keep in mind: the reference coffee will change as the days progress, so you can’t use any given sample for very long. In general, in my first roasting of a particular type of coffee, I aim for a medium brown that resembles a light mahogany. (Aside from color, another way to assess when coffee is roasted to a medium level is if oil is visible, like little pin pricks, on the surface of the beans five to six days after roasting, but of course you can’t use that indicator while roasting.) ([Location 903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=903))
- Place a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C) for 30 minutes or more, using an oven thermometer to ensure the temperature is accurate. Just like Blue Bottle’s Probat coffee roasters and La Marzocco espresso machines, your oven has significant thermal mass, and the longer you allow it to preheat, the more stable the temperature will remain when you open the door during roasting. If you have a gram scale that weighs to tenths of a gram, now is the time to use it (so that later you can most accurately determine the percentage of weight the coffee loses during the roasting process). Weigh out 150 grams (5.3 oz) of coffee beans, and spread them in a single layer over the center of the baking sheet, extending over no more than one-half to two-thirds of the baking sheet. (If spread all the way to the edges of the pan, the beans tend to singe around the edges.) Have the sieves at hand, turn on any vent fans, open any windows, and consider turning off the smoke alarm in the kitchen. (But if you do, remember to turn it back on after roasting.) Put the pan in the oven, close the oven door, and start the stopwatch. If you have a reasonable view through the glass of your oven door, you can observe the coffee’s progress. If you have an old oven with no glass or poor visibility through your glass door, resist the temptation to open the door too often, as this will allow too much heat to escape. Open the door no more than every 90 to 120 seconds at first, increasing the frequency only as the roast progresses. Don’t open the door for more than 4 to 5 seconds at a time, using a good flashlight if need be to quickly observe the coffee. Here’s a timeline of how the roasting should proceed. 2 TO 3½ MINUTES: The beans will take on a brighter, more intense green color. 3½ TO 4 MINUTES: The coffee will start to turn yellow. Write down when this happens. Open the oven and agitate the baking sheet to bring in the outer beans to the center. 5½ MINUTES: The coffee will start to take on a light brown color, but the beans will still be small and wrinkly. Agitate again if the outer beans are getting dark more quickly. 7 OR 8 MINUTES: You will start hearing the first crack, which sounds similar to popcorn popping. Write down when this happens. 20 TO 30 SECONDS PAST FIRST CRACK: Agitate the pan. 45 SECONDS PAST FIRST CRACK (AT AROUND 9 MINUTES): Fast popping means that the coffee is changing dramatically. At that point, it’s just a matter of taste. You will learn to associate the accelerando of the pops with a taste profile that you either enjoy or don’t, and, hence, can adjust in future batches. Toward the end of the first crack, the popping will decelerate and there will be a moment of silence prior to second crack. The more momentum the roast has, the shorter the moment will be before second crack. Take the coffee out before you think it’s done, just like a steak. It will continue to cook by virtue of its own thermal mass. Preferably on a back… ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=920))

- The cupping ratio we use at Blue Bottle is 17 parts water to 1 part coffee, so you’ll need about 150 grams of water for each sample cup to follow our ratio precisely. Conveniently, 1 gram of water is 1 milliliter of water by volume, so that comes to 150 milliliters (5 fl oz) of water per cup. Let sit 3 to 5 minutes.

- However, if you’re brewing coffee in a French press, nel drip, or siphon, or making Turkish coffee, a whirly blade grinder will be a source of frustration. Because these grinders don’t produce a consistent particle size, the smaller particles will overextract and the larger particles will underextract. This inconsistent extraction makes for an unreliable and often unpleasant result. Therefore, for these styles of coffee, you need an adjustable grinder that will reliably produce particles of approximately equal size—a burr grinder. This style of grinder crushes the beans between two metal disks (called burrs) with sharp ridges that spin at speeds of 500 to 1,500 rpm, with the distance between the burrs being adjustable to a very fine degree. ([Location 1162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1162))
- Good-quality electric burr grinders typically cost from $100 to $300. Select a grinder with larger grinding burrs, heavier overall weight, and a lower rpm motor. The higher the rpm of the motor, the greater the tendency to heat the coffee, which causes inconsistencies in grind size and also runs the risk of losing some flavor. Also look for larger numbers of grind settings or, for the most flexibility, a stepless grinder, which allows you to adjust the grind size without being locked into specific settings. ([Location 1172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1172))
- Darker-roasted coffees generally benefit from narrower, or tighter, brewing ratios (meaning smaller amounts of water per a given amount of coffee). They also benefit from larger particle size, more recent roasting, and lower-temperature water. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1177))
- In Japan, a 10-to-1 brewing ratio is pretty standard, but I’ve seen ratios anywhere from 4 to 1 to 15 to 1, with the combination of brewing ratio, pouring technique, brewing temperature, and contact time coming together to create the sought-after taste and texture. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1182))
- The drippers with a large hole (often made by Hario and referred to by the model name V60) are experiencing an uptick in popularity in the United States, primarily (in my opinion) because they produce a cup of coffee more quickly. The downside is that it’s very difficult, though not impossible, to control the pour so the water spends enough time in contact with the coffee. I haven’t been to a single café in Japan that uses V60s. Kono drippers are superficially similar to the Hario V60s in that they have a large hole at the bottom, but they have a different interior geometry that tends to make extracting excellent coffee easier and more repeatable. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1188))
- I generally like a total brewing time of 3 to 3½ minutes, which works out to about 1.5 seconds per milliliter. While it’s fairly obvious that you can vary the extraction rate by the speed at which you pour, grind size is also a factor. A finer grind will extract more slowly, regardless of the rate at which you pour. Extraction will also be slower if you’re using a grinder that produces a lot of fines, powdery particles that can clog the pores of the filter. ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1194))
- In regard to the direction in which water should be poured, at the Ueshima Coffee Co. Academy in Japan, the adamant answer is clockwise. Always clockwise. In your own kitchen, this rule is flexible. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1199))
- Generally, the lighter the roast, the hotter water you want to pour, up to a max of about 205°F (96°C). A wider water-to-coffee ratio and a finer grind may also indicate that a higher temperature will yield more delicious results. But some of the most memorable coffees I’ve ever tasted in Japan have been darker-roast coffees made using small brewing ratios, large particle size, and extremely low brewing temperatures—175°F (79°C). Generally, water that is between 190°F and 205°F (88°C and 96°C) yields the best results, but experimenting is a fun part of the process. As a rule, the longer the extraction period, the lower the water temperature should be. Otherwise you risk heat damaging the coffee.

- About 20 fluid ounces (2½ cups / 590 ml) good-quality water • Swan-necked kettle • Gram scale • 20 to 35 grams (0.7 to 1.2 oz) coffee beans • Coffee grinder • Thermocouple or other thermometer • Ceramic coffee dripper • Coffee cup • Paper filter (kenaf or bamboo-based paper is best) ([Location 1233](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1233))

- You will need 10 fluid ounces (300 ml) of good-quality water for your coffee, so put double that amount in a kettle or other vessel used only for heating water. Why double? Because you’ll use some of the water to preheat the dripper and cup. Put the kettle over high heat. While the water is heating, weigh out the coffee; the amount depends on the brewing ratio you’ll use, from 20 grams for a 15-to-1 ratio to 30 grams for a 10-to-1 ratio. Grind the coffee finely enough that it forms a clump when pressed between your thumb and forefinger; it should feel soft but still a bit gritty. Grind size and evenness is one of the few immeasurable factors—at least at home. At the roastery, we measure particle size and distribution of the powdery particles called fines when evaluating grinders, but at home intuition rules. Change it up and try different settings to find one you like. When the water comes to a boil, pour it into the swan-necked kettle, then let it sit until the temperature is between 185°F and 205°F (85°C and 96°C). (Your choice of water temperature should be based on the type of coffee and roast level that you’re serving.) Warm the ceramic dripper and cup with some of the remaining hot water. Put the filter in the dripper and pour in the ground coffee. The coffee should naturally take the shape of a gentle mound. Place your now-empty but warm cup on your gram scale, set the coffee-filled ceramic dripper on top, and tare the scale. Gently and slowly drizzle a small amount of hot water in the center of the mound of coffee, away from the sides of the filter and making a circle about the size of a quarter. The goal is to pour in just enough water that the coffee will absorb all of it without any liquid dripping into your cup. Coffee generally holds double its weight in water. This is easy to check if your cup, dripper, and coffee assemblage is set up on your gram scale. For example, if you have 35 grams (1.2 oz) of ground coffee in the filter and have tared the scale, add water until the scale reads 70 grams (2.5 oz). Voilà! Pouring in water in such a way that none comes out is a skill. The better you are at soaking the coffee mass evenly, then the more water it will absorb. Can you pour twice the weight of the ground coffee amount without any dripping? 1.75 times? 2.25 times? You can take satisfaction from doing this well, but it isn’t just a geeky fine point; it has an impact on the coffee you brew. It facilitates blooming, the process in which hot water causes the coffee to expand outward in a fascinating way. Allow it to bloom for 30 to 45 seconds, or up to 60 seconds for coffee roasted over 1 week previously. A slightly longer blooming time can add a lot of depth and vitality to older coffee. Pour in more water, once again pouring slowly in a small circular pattern in the middle of the filter. A light-brown cap should rise; at Blue Bottle we call it “the mushroom.” The pace of your pour should be approximately equivalent to the speed at which… ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1239))
- French Press Coffee For each 355 milliliters (12 fl oz) of water, use 20 to 35 grams (0.7 to 1.2 oz) of ground coffee, using more coffee if brewing a darker-roast coffee or adding condiments. For denser, lighter-roasted coffee or serving without condiments, I recommend the slotted-spoon method for removing grounds prior to plunging, with a brewing ratio of about 12 to 1, which translates to about 28 grams (1 oz) of coffee per 355 ml (12 fl oz) of water. WHAT YOU’LL NEED • Good-quality water • Gram scale • Coffee beans • Coffee grinder, preferably a burr grinder • Thermocouple or other thermometer • French press • Chopstick or wooden spoon • Timer • Medium-size slotted spoon (optional) However much finished coffee you wish to brew, put double that amount of good-quality water in a kettle or other vessel used only for heating water. (You’ll use some of the water to preheat the empty French press and cup.) While the water is heating, weigh out the coffee; the amount depends on the brewing ratio you’ll use, for each 355-milliliter (12 fl oz) serving, use from 20 grams for a 15-to-1 ratio to 35 grams for a 10-to-1 ratio. Grind the coffee—not too finely. The grind should be gritty, resembling beach sand that’s pleasant to walk on, but not too powdery. When the water is hot but not quite boiling, at about 198°F (92°C), remove it from the heat. Pour some of the hot water into the empty French press to warm it up. After a few seconds, pour the water from the French press into your cup to warm it as well. Put the ground coffee in the press pot and pour the amount of water desired in a thin stream over the grounds. Gently stir the coffee with the chopstick. Place the stem on the pot with the filter about ½ inch (1.3 cm) above the grounds. Let the coffee steep for 3 minutes. Remove the stem, and for a full-bodied final result, briefly and gently stir with a chopstick. For a finer-bodied coffee, don’t stir; instead, use a medium-size slotted spoon to remove the coffee grounds from the top of the pot. Replace the stem and gently push the grounds down to the bottom of the pot. If the plunger thunks to the bottom with almost no resistance, your grind is too coarse. If you have to strain to get the plunger to the bottom of the pot, your grind is too fine. Using too fine a grind can be dangerous. If the stem torques as you’re wrestling with it, near-boiling water and coffee grounds could spray all over you. Ideally, the plunger will lower smoothly and gradually with 15 to 20 pounds (6.8 to 9.1 kg) of pressure. If you’re not sure what that feels like, press down on your bathroom scale with the flat of your hand until the scale reads 20 pounds (9.1 kg). It should take 15 to 20 seconds to push the plunger to the bottom. When you have pushed the plunger down as far down as it will go, serve immediately.

- Then we attempt to communicate a style: Paper drip? Demitasse? At Chatei Hatou, demitasse-style coffee means nel drip, and that means coffee filtered through a flannel sack suspended from a wire hoop. This method produces a coffee of extraordinary density and the most lapidary sweetness due to a tight brewing ratio, extremely low brewing temperature, and a very, very ponderous extraction regimen. (Read more about nel drip.) ([Location 1346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1346))
- The hallmarks of this style of nel drip are characterized by low brewing temperatures (approximately 175°F or 79°C), slow extraction, older coffee (post-roast), course grind, and very tight brewing ratios. For me the magic of nel drip is the texture. A beautifully made nel drip is radiant and plump—substantial like espresso without the same intensity, and thicker than a French press without the graininess. It is syrupy yet not heavy. The aftertaste, while shorter in duration than an espresso, is more intense. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1398))
- WHAT YOU’LL NEED • Nel drip filter • Soft-bristle brush • Coffee beans, ideally 1 to 3 weeks after roasting • Gram scale • Coffee grinder • Thin bamboo paddle, offset spatula, or butter knife • About 200 ml (6.8 fl oz) good-quality water • Thermocouple • Swan-necked kettle • Timer • Carafe ([Location 1414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1414))
- Bring the water to a boil and grind 40 to 50 grams (1.4 to 1.8 oz) of coffee. The grind should be quite coarse—coarser than a French press grind—and the coffee should feel gritty and sharp. Individual particles of coffee should be easily discernable even if you are not wearing your reading glasses. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1423))
- Set the nel over a carafe that does not contact the sides of the nel. Place nel and carafe on a gram scale and tare. Place a timer next to your nel. Pour the hot water into a swan-necked kettle. Let the water cool to approximately 175°F (79°C). Yes, this is a very low temperature. Start the timer and begin drizzling water around the circumference of the nickel-sized indentation you made in the mass of coffee. Clockwise, of course. Don’t worry about saturating all of the coffee. Time and the principle of capillarity will take care of that. Pour over approximately 45 ml (1.5 fl oz) of water over 45 to 60 seconds. Pause for 45 seconds. The coffee should look active and be churning upward. After your pause, pour 80 ml (2.7 fl oz) of water in the same pattern but slightly faster, over 60 to 80 seconds. A cap should form over the coffee that is the approximate size, shape, and color of a button mushroom cap. Keep the mushroom in the center of the nel! Pause for 20 seconds. Next, add 60 ml (2 fl oz) of water at an even faster pace—about 30 seconds. The end result is 185 ml (6.2 fl oz) of water poured over 3 minutes, 20 seconds. About 100 ml (3.4 fl oz) will be in the carafe, the rest will be captured by the coffee grounds. Remove the nel from the carafe before all the liquid has dripped out.

- TROUBLESHOOTING If you are having problems making delicious coffees with this preparation method, these are often the culprits: • Too high brewing temperature • Too fine a grind • Too long a brew cycle • Coffee that is too close to its roast date • Inadequately cared-for nel (i.e., dirty, dry, moldy) ([Location 1449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007UH9A84&location=1449))
- A dozen kinds of drippers, swan-necked kettles, siphons, siphon bars, kenaf-paper filters, bamboo-paper filters, nel drip kits, and mysterious drippers for iced coffee that resemble grandfather clocks, not to mention the siphons and siphon lights that I noticed in Tokyo during my first trip to Japan when I was nineteen years old.

- Add the dry coffee on top of the water. Don’t stir. Place the ibrik on the smallest burner on the stove over medium heat. The coffee should foam up after 2 to 3 minutes, depending upon the size of the ibrik. As it approaches this point, you’ll see some churning and seething as the water vapor pressurizes under the cap of ground coffee. Then it will start to foam and look like it’s boiling. Immediately pull the ibrik off the heat. Let the bubbles subside, then place the ibrik back on the heat and repeat. The coffee will foam up much more quickly the second time. When it does, remove the ibrik from the heat. Repeat a third time. At this point, there will hopefully be a fairly persistent layer of foam on top of the coffee. Carefully pour the foam equally into the number of cups you’re serving (dividing the foam equally is important for ensuring that all your guests have foam, as that is a traditional indicator of good hospitality). Slide the rest of the coffee down the side of each cup, being careful not to dissipate the foam. Serve immediately. The silty powdered coffee will settle to the bottom of each cup, so be careful not to drink the last few sips.
