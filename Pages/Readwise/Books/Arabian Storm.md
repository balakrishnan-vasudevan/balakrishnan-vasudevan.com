## Highlights
- The docile vista he watched through his periscope lens did not fool Commander Ashwinder Vikat. As commanding officer of the submarine INS Argihat SSBN 86, the Indian Navy’s newest ballistic missile-armed nuclear submarine, his instincts told him better.

- A drawback of living in this isolated mountain cave—although only a minor one considering the many advantages—was that his people were required to make the dangerous and time-consuming trek to report even the most mundane activities or to receive guidance in carrying out their missions. Employing the usual modern communications technology was certainly possible. Nabiin’s organization owned plenty of it and had the capability to use it. But the risks of detection, of someone catching wind of the momentous events about to play out, were simply too high. Nabiin had learned the lessons obvious in the fate of the late Osama bin Laden. The Prophet knew to remain safely hidden, well back in the shadows, even in supposedly friendly territory. To deal harshly with even the most minor slips in secrecy or discretion. And he did not employ the available electronic systems, no matter how much easier they would have made communication between his far-flung network and his mountaintop aerie. When necessary and prudent, Nabiin summoned several of his top commanders for a strategy session. In person, carefully concealed, with intricate steps taken so as not to raise the suspicions of some intelligence agency somewhere. Just such a meeting was now playing out before the Prophet. “The Chinese continue to expand their facilities in Gwadar,” reported Farian Gurmani, one of the two men standing in the back of the chamber. “Their submarine piers will handle at least six vessels at a time, even including nuclear-powered ones. And they continue to construct facilities for their surface fleet. Especially impressive are the ones for their aircraft carriers.” ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07ZG6RDPR&location=768))
- The yellow unmanned underwater vehicle nudged its nose into the shallow waters just above a small sea mount. The feature was little more than a mound rising from the sea floor, but its exact position and depth were recorded precisely within the UUV’s data files. The depth readings from the little submersible’s sensors almost matched the reading logged in its data files. Even so, the vessel maneuvered slightly until the evaluations matched within the tolerances that it was programmed to accept. Precision was only one of the device’s strengths. Then, satisfied that it was where it was supposed to be, the electronic brain within the sub adjusted its inertial navigation system so that the estimated position—the “EP”—agreed with the bottom contour fix on the sea mount below. The UUV would rely on the inertial navigation system and its EPs for the next several hours for dead reckoning. On this critical leg of the mission, the submersible could not risk coming to the surface to use its GPS receiver and there were no convenient sea mounts for bottom contour navigation. The vessel slowly and silently worked its way toward the coastline. The muddy bottom gradually rose to put less and less water beneath the little craft. At the same time, the UUV’s sensors detected currents trying to push it along the coast, away from where it had been ordered to go. Still other sensors detected a ship steaming toward the UUV. The submarine knew exactly what to do. It automatically maneuvered to keep well away from the ship. And it adjusted for a course that would take it precisely where it was supposed to be, even as it compensated for the unexpected currents. Finally, the UUV’s inertial navigation EP agreed with the programmed position for “event one.” A small hatch on the submersible’s bottom opened and a sensor package dropped out. The package sank to the muddy bottom where it gently rested in the silt. As the UUV circled and passed by again, a float deployed from the package, rising up until it stopped a couple of fathoms from the surface. Then the device on the bottom emitted one short ping informing the hovering UUV that all was operational. With that confirmation duly noted, the unmanned submarine turned further to the northwest and headed for its next drop point. Ten hours later, the yellow UUV completed its first mission and headed back out to deeper water. There it reported home, confirmed its success, and waited patiently for the code that would give the submersible the details of, and send it off on, its next mission. Back at the command center, lights blinked on as the stretch of sensors began to come to life, completing a virtual set of tripwires across the Iranian coast. They covered what appeared to be an uninteresting and unimportant stretch of shoreline from Gurdim to Beris, across the backwater Chabahar Bay. But to some, this remote arc of sand and seawater constituted some of the most important geography on Planet Earth.
