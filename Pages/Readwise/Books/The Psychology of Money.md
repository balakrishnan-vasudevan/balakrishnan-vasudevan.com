## Highlights
- People from different generations, raised by different parents who earned different incomes and held different values, in different parts of the world, born into different economies, experiencing different job markets with different incentives and different degrees of luck, learn very different lessons. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=126))
- Only the paranoid survive? ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=645))
- We assume that tomorrow won’t be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We can’t be complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into tomorrow’s good fortune. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=646))
- 1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=678))
- Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan. ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=686))
- A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=702))
- Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=754))
- The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.” ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=875))
- Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. ([Location 885](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=885))
- More than your salary. More than the size of your house. More than the prestige of your job. Control over doing what you want, when you want to, with the people you want to, is the broadest lifestyle variable that makes people happy. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=887))
- Take it from those who have lived through everything: Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays. ([Location 972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=972))
- The world is filled with people who look modest but are actually wealthy and people who look rich who live at the razor’s edge of insolvency. Keep this in mind when quickly judging others’ success and setting your own goals. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1047))
- Everyone needs the basics. Once they’re covered there’s another level of comfortable basics, and past that there’s basics that are both comfortable, entertaining, and enlightening. ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1093))
- But spending beyond a pretty low level of materialism is mostly a reflection of ego approaching income, a way to spend money to show people that you have (or had) money. ([Location 1094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1094))
- one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1096))
- That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1115))
- History can be a misleading guide to the future of the economy and stock market because it doesn’t account for structural changes that are relevant to today’s world. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1327))
- The 401(k) is 42 years old. The Roth IRA is younger, created in the 1990s. So personal financial advice and analysis about how Americans save for retirement today is not directly comparable to what made sense just a generation ago. We have new options. Things changed. ([Location 1329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1329))
- History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable from bad ideas. The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance—“unknowns”—are an ever-present part of life. ([Location 1416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1416))
- “the purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.” ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1421))
- Use room for error when estimating your future returns. This is more art than science. For my own investments, which I’ll describe more in chapter 20, I assume the future returns I’ll earn in my lifetime will be ⅓ lower than the historic average. So I save more than I would if I assumed the future will resemble the past. It’s my margin of safety. The future may be worse than ⅓ lower than the past, but no margin of safety offers a 100% guarantee. A one-third buffer is enough to allow me to sleep well at night. And if the future does resemble the past, I’ll be pleasantly surprised. “The best way to achieve felicity is to aim low,” says Charlie Munger. Wonderful. ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1465))
- We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you’ll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a point of regret. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1576))
- Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you. ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1598))
- Responding to critics who said his actions were wrong and what he should have done was obvious, Immelt told his successor, “Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it.” Every job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it because the challenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to those in the crowd. ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1614))
- Most things are harder in practice than they are in theory. Sometimes this is because we’re overconfident. More often it’s because we’re not good at identifying what the price of success is, which prevents us from being able to pay it. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1619))
- “Hold stocks for the long run,” you’ll hear. It’s good advice. But do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing? ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1623))
- Try to get the return while avoiding the volatility that comes along with it. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1640))
- The question is: Why do so many people who are willing to pay the price of cars, houses, food, and vacations try so hard to avoid paying the price of good investment returns? The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided. You’re supposed to make decisions that preempt and avoid fines. Traffic fines and IRS fines mean you did something wrong and deserve to be punished. The natural response for anyone who watches their wealth decline and views that drop as a fine is to avoid future fines. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1674))
- where volatility is almost always a fee, not a fine. Market returns are never free and never will be. They demand you pay a price, like any other product. You’re not forced to pay this fee, just like you’re not forced to go to Disneyland. You can go to the local county fair where tickets might be $10, or stay home for free. You might still have a good time. But you’ll usually get what you pay for. Same with markets. The volatility/uncertainty fee—the price of returns—is the cost of admission to get returns greater than low-fee parks like cash and bonds. The trick is convincing yourself that the market’s fee is worth it. That’s the only way to properly deal with volatility and uncertainty—not just putting up with it, but realizing that it’s an admission fee worth paying. There’s no guarantee that it will be. Sometimes it rains at Disneyland. But if you view the admission fee as a fine, you’ll never enjoy the magic. Find the price, then pay it. ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1685))
- Investors often innocently take cues from other investors who are playing a different game than they are. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1709))
- When investors have different goals and time horizons—and they do in every asset class—prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another, because the factors those investors pay attention to are different. ([Location 1719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1719))
- An iron rule of finance is that money chases returns to the greatest extent that it can. If an asset has momentum—it’s been moving consistently up for a period of time—it’s not crazy for a group of short-term traders to assume it will keep moving up. Not indefinitely; just for the short period of time they need it to. Momentum attracts short-term traders in a reasonable way. Then it’s off to the races. Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1725))
- The formation of bubbles isn’t so much about people irrationally participating in long-term investing. They’re about people somewhat rationally moving toward short-term trading to capture momentum that had been feeding on itself. ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1752))
- Being swayed by people playing a different game can also throw off how you think you’re supposed to spend your money. So much consumer spending, particularly in developed countries, is socially driven: subtly influenced by people you admire, and done because you subtly want people to admire you. ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1776))
- But while we can see how much money other people spend on cars, homes, clothes, and vacations, we don’t get to see their goals, worries, and aspirations. A young lawyer aiming to be a partner at a prestigious law firm might need to maintain an appearance that I, a writer who can work in sweatpants, have no need for. But when his purchases set my own expectations, I’m wandering down a path of potential disappointment because I’m spending the money without the career boost he’s getting. We might not even have different styles. We’re just playing a different game. It took me years to figure this out. ([Location 1778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1778))

- A takeaway here is that few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing different games than you are. The main thing I can recommend is going out of your way to identify what game you’re playing. ([Location 1783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1783))
- Real optimists don’t believe that everything will be great. That’s complacency. Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. The simple idea that most people wake up in the morning trying to make things a little better and more productive than wake up looking to cause trouble is the foundation of optimism. It’s not complicated. It’s not guaranteed, either. It’s just the most reasonable bet for most people, most of the time. The late statistician Hans Rosling put it differently: “I am not an optimist. I am a very serious possibilist.” ([Location 1798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1798))
- Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce. ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1854))
- Another is that pessimists often extrapolate present trends without accounting for how markets adapt. ([Location 1879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1879))
- A third is that progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore. ([Location 1902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1902))
- Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant. ([Location 1927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1927))
- 1. The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1986))
- An appealing fiction happens when you are smart, you want to find solutions, but face a combination of limited control and high stakes. They are extremely powerful. They can make you believe just about anything. ([Location 1994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=1994))
- This is a big part of why room for error, flexibility, and financial independence—important themes discussed in previous chapters—are indispensable. The bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what you need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more you are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing financial fiction. When thinking about room for error in a forecast it is tempting to think that potential outcomes range from you being just right enough to you being very, very right. But the biggest risk is that you want something to be true so badly that the range of your forecast isn’t even in the same ballpark as reality.

- 2. Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps. ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2045))
- Most people, when confronted with something they don’t understand, do not realize they don’t understand it because they’re able to come up with an explanation that makes sense based on their own unique perspective and experiences in the world, however limited those experiences are. We all want the complicated world we live in to make sense. So we tell ourselves stories to fill in the gaps of what are effectively blind spots. ([Location 2069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2069))
- When planning we focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others whose decisions might affect our outcomes. Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs. ([Location 2098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2098))
- Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong. Because it’s never as good or as bad as it looks. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are both real and hard to identify. Do so when judging both yourself and others. Respect the power of luck and risk and you’ll have a better chance of focusing on things you can actually control. You’ll also have a better chance of finding the right role models. Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. ([Location 2150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2150))
- Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. ([Location 2156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2156))
- If you want to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is… ([Location 2160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2160))
- Become OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes. No matter what you’re doing with your money you should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not working. That’s just how the world is. So you should always measure… ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2162))
- Use money to gain control over your time, because not having control of your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance. Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and chrome. Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical emergency. But saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save. Everyone’s life is a continuous chain of surprises. Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment. Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free. And remember that most financial costs don’t have visible price tags. Uncertainty, doubt, and regret are common costs in the finance world. They’re often worth paying. But you have to view them as fees (a price worth paying to get something nice in exchange) rather than fines (a penalty you should avoid). Worship room for error. A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over. Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions. Everyone’s goals and desires will change over time, and the more extreme your past decisions were the more you may regret them as you evolve. You… ([Location 2167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2167))
- The difference between what someone suggests you do and what they do for themselves isn’t always a bad thing. It just underscores that when dealing with complicated and emotional issues that affect you and your family, there is no one right answer. There is no universal truth. There’s only what works for you and your family, checking the boxes you want checked in a way that leaves you comfortable and sleeping well at night. ([Location 2203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2203))
- And achieving some level of independence does not rely on earning a doctor’s income. It’s mostly a matter of keeping your expectations in check and living below your means. Independence, at any income level, is driven by your savings rate. And past a certain level of income your savings rate is driven by your ability to keep your lifestyle expectations from running away. ([Location 2223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2223))
- We also keep a higher percentage of our assets in cash than most financial advisors would recommend—something around 20% of our assets outside the value of our house. This is also close to indefensible on paper, and I’m not recommending it to others. It’s just what works for us. We do it because cash is the oxygen of independence, and—more importantly—we never want to be forced to sell the stocks we own. We want the probability of facing a huge expense and needing to liquidate stocks to cover it to be as close to zero as possible. Perhaps we just have a lower risk tolerance than others. But everything I’ve learned about personal finance tells me that everyone—without exception—will eventually face a huge expense they did not expect—and they don’t plan for these expenses specifically because they did not expect them. The few people who know the details of our finances ask, “What are you saving for? A house? A boat? A new car?” No, none of those. I’m saving for a world where curveballs are more common than we expect. Not being forced to sell stocks to cover an expense also means we’re increasing the odds of letting the stocks we own compound for the longest period of time. Charlie Munger put it well: “The first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.” ([Location 2250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084HJSJJ2&location=2250))
- One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there is little correlation between investment effort and investment results. The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a few variables account for the majority of returns. No matter how hard you try at investing you won’t do well if you miss the two or three things that move the needle in your strategy. The reverse is true. Simple investment strategies can work great as long as they capture the few things that are important to that strategy’s success. My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking about those three things—especially the first two, which I can control.
