## Highlights
- ‘The moment Dilawar is eliminated, his network will start imploding. As our friends in the RAW will confirm, Irshad Dilawar is the only reason the network is still holding up. You must be aware that there is a power struggle brewing within Dilawar’s empire, with his brother Feroz and his loyalists on one side and his trusted lieutenant Munna Riyaaz and his foot soldiers on the other.’ ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=280))
- Taking off his reading glasses, Colonel Mohan pinched the bridge of his nose. ‘Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time,’ he said. ‘Intelligence reports say that in seventeen days, Dilawar will be in Karachi to meet some of his Saudi Arabian business associates. He will be in the city for just three days before returning to one or the other of his many hideouts in Pakistan. Honestly, we have no idea which one he will move to next. So those three days are the only window available to get him.’ ‘Do we have to get him in Karachi? I mean, if we planned this thoroughly, we could do the job anywhere. Islamabad, Peshawar...’ ‘When it comes to Irshad Dilawar, facts are few and far between,’ the colonel said with a thin smile. ‘So it’s in our interest to act on whatever little facts we have. This time we have definite information that he’s going to be in Karachi in seventeen days. Next time, who knows...?’ Colonel Mohan stood up and stretched his stiff back muscles. ‘Karachi is also ideal for this operation because our intelligence network in that city is more reliable than anywhere else in Pakistan. You stand your best chance of completing this job in Karachi. Secondly, Karachi is a big port city with a large floating population. There are fewer chances of anyone noticing three new faces in a city of that size. Outside Karachi, the possibility of detection rises significantly. Lastly, because of its coastline, the city is best suited for a quick escape by sea, once the operation is over.’ ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=571))
- ‘In twenty-four hours.’ The colonel gave a theatrical pause. ‘At noon tomorrow, you guys will leave for the Unit Kilo facility in Panchkula. There, for the next eight days, you will undergo intensive preparation for Project Abhimanyu. We will furnish you with detailed inputs on police and paramilitary deployment across the Pakistani cities you will travel through. You will have access to as much information we can provide on Irshad Dilawar’s movements in Karachi, the kind of security cover he has, the nature and pattern of police force deployment in the city, etc. You will study and familiarize yourselves with the layout of Karachi through photographs, satellite pictures and video recordings. You will acquaint yourself with the city’s arterial roads, the distances between landmarks and major localities in Karachi, and also with the key entry and exit points. And you will go through each and every aspect of the operation at least three times a day, tightly coordinating the critical aspect of timing.’ ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=588))
- ‘One stranger in an alien land attracts far less attention than three strangers travelling together,’ the colonel explained. ‘So till you reach Karachi and are in Saadat’s hands, you guys are better off alone. Also, if you go in together and get caught, the entire operation comes apart. But if you go in separately and one gets caught, the other two can still carry out the assignment.’ ‘The three of us will have no contact with one another till we reach Karachi, right sir?’ asked Imtiaz.

- ‘Each one of you will be given a watch that you are to wear constantly till the time you meet Saadat in Karachi,’ Colonel Mohan explained. ‘Each watch has an extremely small but exceedingly powerful GPS tracking unit embedded in it, which is linked to Unit Kilo via satellite. These GPS units will be monitored round-the-clock to track your progress. Should any one of you run into serious trouble with Pakistani authorities on your way to Karachi, find a way of destroying the GPS unit immediately. Two reasons: one, we don’t want prying eyes to find those high-tech GPS units concealed in your watches. Two, the moment we stop receiving signals from any of the units, we will assume the worst and immediately relay the information to Saadat. Saadat will then inform the others about this when they reach Karachi. In such an eventuality, you are to abandon Plan A and set Plan B in motion.’ Nearly a full minute elapsed in silence. Assuming they were done for the time being, the colonel was preparing to conclude the meeting when Imtiaz spoke again. ‘Sir, it seems we are relying a lot on Saadat for this operation. He’s our point man in Karachi for information, supplies, logistics support, and even arms and ammunition. We’re putting so much trust on one person—how reliable is he?’ ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=609))
- His identity having been established through a chain of passwords, Saadat could hear a faint hum as his call was patched through to Colonel Mohan, somewhere in India. He was using Secure Voice over IP to file his report, and the connection was completely encrypted to defend against Pakistani packet sniffers. His conversation with the colonel was virtually unbreakable. ([Location 1383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=1383))
- Extra caution must be paid to all speedboats and high performance rigid-inflatable boats docked or moored in the vicinity of Karachi. Then inform all the telecommunication companies that we expect their continued cooperation in monitoring all telephone conversations on their networks.

- ‘If the border with Afghanistan is unsafe, we have to overrule Saidu Sharif, Miramshah and Quetta as well. Even Peshawar could be perilous. We can’t risk Murree as it’s too close to India-controlled Kashmir, and Karachi is already out.’ Lieutenant-General Niazi curbed the temptation to speak up. He had to time this right. ‘Why don’t we move him to Islamabad or Rawalpindi?’ Major-General Dar suggested. ‘He’ll be closer to us and we can protect him better.’ ([Location 2135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=2135))
- ‘That only leaves us with Panjgur and Gwadar,’ ([Location 2151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=2151))
- ‘These attempts might even have been masterminded by some Pakistanis. Dilawar has lots of businesses in Karachi and Sindh that clash with the commercial interests of many Pakistani politicians and businessmen. So there’s a high level of resentment towards him within Pakistan. For the last three years, one prominent Pakistani minister has been lobbying privately to have Dilawar extradited to India. Can you beat that?’ ([Location 4400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BLV25HVQ&location=4400))
