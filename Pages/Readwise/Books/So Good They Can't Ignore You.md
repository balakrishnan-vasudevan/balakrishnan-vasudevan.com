## Highlights
- In which I question the validity of the passion hypothesis, which says that the key to occupational happiness is to match your job to a pre-existing passion. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=183))
- In Wrzesniewski’s research, the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do. On reflection, this makes sense. If you have many years’ experience, then you’ve had time to get better at what you do and develop a feeling of efficacy. It also gives you time to develop strong relationships with your coworkers and to see many examples of your work benefiting others. What’s important here, however, is that this explanation, though reasonable, contradicts the passion hypothesis, which instead emphasizes the immediate happiness that comes from matching your job to a true passion. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=331))
- Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=343))
- Competence and autonomy, for example, are achievable by most people in a wide variety of jobs—assuming they’re willing to put in the hard work required for mastery. This message is not as inspiring as “follow your passion and you’ll immediately be happy,” but it certainly has a ring of truth. In other words, working right trumps finding the right work. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=352))
- “Nobody ever takes note of [my advice], because it’s not the answer they wanted to hear,” Martin said. “What they want to hear is ‘Here’s how you get an agent, here’s how you write a script,’… but I always say, ‘Be so good they can’t ignore you.’ ” In response to Rose’s trademark ambiguous grunt, Martin defended his advice: “If somebody’s thinking, ‘How can I be really good?’ people are going to come to you.” This is exactly the philosophy that catapulted Martin into stardom. He was only twenty years old when he decided to innovate his act into something too good to be ignored. “Comedy at the time was all setup and punch line… the clichéd nightclub comedian, rat-a-tat-tat,” Martin explained to Rose.3 He thought it could be something more sophisticated. Here’s how Martin explained his evolution in an article he published around the time of his Charlie Rose interview: “What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? What if I headed for a climax, but all I delivered was an anticlimax?”4 In one famous bit, Martin tells the audience that it’s time for his famous nose-on-the-microphone routine. He then leans in and puts his nose on the microphone for several seconds, steps back, takes a long bow, and with gravitas thanks the crowd. “The laugh came not then,” he explains, “but only after they realized I had already moved on to the next bit.” ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=480))
- “[Eventually] you are so experienced [that] there’s a confidence that comes out,” Martin explained. “I think it’s something the audience smells.” ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=493))
- he agreed that an obsessive focus on the quality of what you produce is the rule in professional music. “It trumps your appearance, your equipment, your personality, and your connections,” he explained. “Studio musicians have this adage: ‘The tape doesn’t lie.’ Immediately after the recording comes the playback; your ability has no hiding place.” ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=514))
- If you’re not focusing on becoming so good they can’t ignore you, you’re going to be left behind. This clarity was refreshing. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=518))
- Whereas the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what the world can offer you. This mindset is how most people approach their working lives. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=527))
- First, when you focus only on what your work offers you, it makes you hyperaware of what you don’t like about it, leading to chronic unhappiness. This is especially true for entry-level positions, which, by definition, are not going to be filled with challenging projects and autonomy—these come later. When you enter the working world with the passion mindset, the annoying tasks you’re assigned or the frustrations of corporate bureaucracy can become too much to handle. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=530))
- the deep questions driving the passion mindset—“Who am I?” and “What do I truly love?”—are essentially impossible to confirm. “Is this who I really am?” and “Do I love this?” rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no responses. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to keep you perpetually unhappy and confused, which probably explains why Bronson admits, not long into his career-seeker epic What Should I Do With My Life? that “the one feeling everyone in this book has experienced is of missing out on life.”7 ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=534))
- there’s something liberating about the craftsman mindset: It asks you to leave behind self-centered concerns about whether your job is “just right,” and instead put your head down and plug away at getting really damn good. No one owes you a great career, it argues; you need to earn it—and the process won’t be easy. ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=542))
- I am suggesting that you put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you. That is, regardless of what you do for a living, approach your work like a true performer. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=546))
- If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset (“what can the world offer me?”) and instead adopt the craftsman mindset (“what can I offer the world?”). ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=575))
- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable. Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital. The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=636))
- There’s a mental strain that accompanies feeling your way through a tune that’s not ingrained in muscle memory, and I hated that feeling. I learned songs reluctantly, then clung to them fiercely once they had become easy for me. I used to get upset when our rhythm guitar player would suggest we try out something new during band practice. He was happy glancing at a chord chart and then jumping in. I wasn’t. Even at that young age I realized that my discomfort with mental discomfort was a liability in the performance world. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=927))
- The Nashville studio musician Mark Casstevens seconded this dedication to constantly stretching your abilities. ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=942))
- This focus on stretching your ability and receiving immediate feedback provides the core of a more universal principle—one that I increasingly came to believe provides the key to successfully acquiring career capital in almost any field. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=949))
- “Most individuals who start as active professionals… change their behavior and increase their performance for a limited time until they reach an acceptable level. Beyond this point, however, further improvements appear to be unpredictable and the number of years of work… is a poor predictor of attained performance.” Put another way, if you just show up and work hard, you’ll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better. This is what happened to me with my guitar playing, to the chess players who stuck to tournament play, and to most knowledge workers who simply put in the hours: We all hit plateaus. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1023))
- Let’s assume you’re a knowledge worker, which is a field without a clear training philosophy. If you can figure out how to integrate deliberate practice into your own life, you have the possibility of blowing past your peers in your value, as you’ll likely be alone in your dedication to systematically getting better. That is, deliberate practice might provide the key to quickly becoming so good they can’t ignore you. ([Location 1029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1029))
- To successfully adopt the craftsman mindset, therefore, we have to approach our jobs in the same way that Jordan approaches his guitar playing or Garry Kasparov his chess training—with a dedication to deliberate practice. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1032))
- This is a great example of deliberate practice at work. “I want to spend time on what’s important, instead of what’s immediate,” ([Location 1088](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1088))
- At the end of every week he prints his numbers to see how well he achieved this goal, and then uses this feedback to guide himself in the week ahead. The fact that he’s been promoted three times in less than three years underscores the effectiveness of this deliberate approach. ([Location 1089](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1089))
- In a winner-take-all market, there is only one type of career capital available, and lots of different people competing for it. Television writing is a winner-take-all market because all that matters is your ability to write good scripts. That is, the only capital type is your script-writing capability. An auction market, by contrast, is less structured: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might generate a unique collection. The cleantech space is an auction market. Mike Jackson’s capital, for example, included expertise in renewable energy markets and entrepreneurship, but there are a variety of other types of relevant skills that also could have led to a job in this field. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1099))
- They inspire their readers. When you correctly understand the market where blogging exists, you stop calculating your bounce rate and start focusing instead on saying something people really care about—which is where your energy should be if you want to succeed. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1123))
- He wasn’t sure exactly what he wanted to do, but he knew it would involve the environment, so he set out to gain any capital relevant to this broad topic. ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1126))
- Getting it started requires a huge application of effort, but changing its track once it’s moving is easy. In other words, it’s hard to start from scratch in a new field. ([Location 1136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1136))
- Deliberate practice is often the opposite of enjoyable. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1156))
- This is what you should experience in your own pursuit of “good.” If you’re not uncomfortable, then you’re probably stuck at an “acceptable level.” ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1161))
- Martin redefines the word so that it’s less about paying attention to your main pursuit, and more about your willingness to ignore other pursuits that pop up along the way to distract you. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1177))
- Acquiring capital can take time. For Alex, it took about two years of serious deliberate practice before his first television script was produced. Mike Jackson was a half decade out of college before cashing in his capital to land a dream job. This is why Martin’s diligence is so important: Without this patient willingness to reject shiny new pursuits, you’ll derail your efforts before you acquire the capital you need. I think the image of Martin returning to his banjo, day after day, for forty years, is poignant. It captures well the feel of how career capital is actually acquired: You stretch yourself, day after day, month after month, before finally looking up and realizing, “Hey, I’ve become pretty good, and people are starting to notice.” ([Location 1179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1179))
- Even with the craftsman mindset, however, becoming “so good they can’t ignore you” is not trivial. To help these efforts I introduced the well-studied concept of deliberate practice, an approach to work where you deliberately stretch your abilities beyond where you’re comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance. Musicians, athletes, and chess players know all about deliberate practice. Knowledge workers, however, do not. This is great news for knowledge workers: If you can introduce this strategy into your working life you can vault past your peers in your acquisition of career capital. ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1196))
- “follow your passion” is bad advice, as the vast majority of people don’t have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered and matched to a job. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1237))
- I then countered that people with compelling careers instead start by getting good at something rare and valuable—building what I called “career capital”—and then cashing in this capital for the traits that make great work great. ([Location 1238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1238))
- finding the right work pales in importance to working right. ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1240))
- You have to get good before you can expect good work. ([Location 1260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1260))
- Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable. ([Location 1337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1337))
- The point at which you have acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point when you’ve become valuable enough to your current employer that they will try to prevent you from making the change. ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1469))
- The Law of Financial Viability When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on. ([Location 1548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1548))
- But capital alone is not enough to make a mission a reality. Plenty of people are good at what they do but haven’t reoriented their career in a compelling direction. Accordingly, I will go on to explore a pair of advanced tactics that also play an important role in making the leap from a good idea for a mission to actually making that mission a reality. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1670))
- missions are a powerful trait to introduce into your working life, but they’re also fickle, requiring careful coaxing to make them a reality. ([Location 1674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1674))
- Hardness scares off the daydreamers and the timid, leaving more opportunity for those like us who are willing to take the time to carefully work out the best path forward and then confidently take action. ([Location 1677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1677))
- understanding the adjacent possible and its role in innovation is the first link in a chain of argument that explains how to identify a good career mission. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1739))
- A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough—it’s an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field ([Location 1744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1744))
- If you want to identify a mission for your working life, therefore, you must first get to the cutting edge—the only place where these missions become visible. ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1745))
- According to Johnson’s theory, Sarah would have been better served by first mastering a promising niche—a task that may take years—and only then turning her attention to seeking a mission. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1750))
- Most people who love their work got where they are by first building up career capital and then cashing it in for the types of traits that define great work. Getting to the cutting edge of a field can be understood in these terms: This process builds up rare and valuable skills and therefore builds up your store of career capital. Similarly, identifying a compelling mission once you get to the cutting edge can be seen as investing your career capital to acquire a desirable trait in your career. In other words, mission is yet another example of career capital theory in action. If you want a mission, you need to first acquire capital. If you skip this step, you might end up like Sarah and Jane: with lots of enthusiasm but very little to show for it. ([Location 1762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1762))
- “It’s just that we don’t know what that passion is. If you ask someone, they’ll tell you what they think they’re passionate about, but they probably have it wrong.” ([Location 1771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1771))
- These are not the actions of someone who is certain of her destiny from day one. This certainty didn’t come until later, around the time of her Nature publication, when Pardis had finally developed her computational genetics ideas to the point where their usefulness and novelty were obvious. ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1799))
- “Think Small, Act Big.” It’s in this understanding of career capital and its role in mission that we get our explanation for this title. Advancing to the cutting edge in a field is an act of “small” thinking, requiring you to focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time. Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and discover a mission in the adjacent possible, you must go after it with zeal: a “big” action. ([Location 1804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1804))
- “Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance,” he writes, “they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins” [emphasis mine]. This rapid and frequent feedback, Sims argues, “allows them to find unexpected avenues and arrive at extraordinary outcomes.” ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1930))
- If career capital makes it possible to identify a compelling mission, then it’s a strategy of little bets that gives you a good shot of succeeding in this mission. To deploy this career tactic, you need both pieces. ([Location 1960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1960))
- In more detail, Giles committed himself to the mission of bringing together the worlds of art and Ruby programming. He made good on this commitment when he released Archaeopteryx, an open-source artificial intelligence program that writes and plays its own dance music. ([Location 1992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=1992))
- He approached the task of finding good projects for his mission with the mindset of a marketer, systematically studying books on the subject to help identify why some ideas catch on while others fall flat. His marketing-centric approach is useful for anyone looking to wield mission as part of their quest for work they love. ([Location 2000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=2000))
- is that a good mission-driven project must be remarkable in two different ways. First, it should be remarkable in the literal sense of compelling people to remark about it. To understand this trait, let’s first look at something that lacks it. ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=2046))
- For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking. ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=2070))
- Working right trumps finding the right work. ([Location 2430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0076DDBJ6&location=2430))
- Don’t obsess over discovering your true calling. Instead, master rare and valuable skills. Once you build up the career capital that these skills generate, invest it wisely. Use it to acquire control over what you do and how you do it, and to identify and act on a life-changing mission. This philosophy is less sexy than the fantasy of dropping everything to go live among the monks in the mountains, but it’s also a philosophy that has been shown time and again to actually work.
