## Highlights
- ‘These are your targets. First, Sabahuddin Umavi: 26/11 mastermind. Second, Wajid Mir: recruiter, trainer and strategist of Lashkar. Third, Damien Bradley: white American, all-round recon man. Fourth, Mahmoud Azhar: fugitive, terrorist. Fifth, Haaris Saeed: the man in charge, the brains behind Lashkar.’ ‘Our objective,’ said Waris quietly, ‘is to eliminate each of these men. With them gone, the Lashkar-e-Toiba will be directionless without a leader. That’s a step in the direction we want to take – to make India safer. Umavi was the mastermind. He’s our first target.’ ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKSD5YI&location=945))
- Few knew about Umavi’s discomfort with technology; it would be foolish to expose the fact that a senior Lashkar-e-Toiba member had a weakness. Qandahari was, however, the most tech savvy recruit Umavi had trained. So, as Umavi took Qandahari under his wing, in addition to guarding Umavi, brainstorming with him and advising him, Qandahari also provided the digital touch to Umavi’s analogue brain.

- Brigadier Arif Jan Afridi became the Pakistan army’s ace weapon against India. He became the mastermind behind the militant infiltration into Kashmir and caused havoc in the country. His ingenious handling of the proxy war got him a fast-track to the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). Every army, intelligence and government organization wanted Afridi on their team. The man was known for his innovative ideas and brilliant, painstakingly drawn up schemes that unsettled his rivals. Among the Pakistani intelligence agencies, which included the Federal Intelligence Agency (FIA), Naval Intelligence, Military Intelligence and Defence Intelligence of Pakistan, the ISI has long been considered the most influential and resourceful organization. In fact, it is widely claimed that the ISI is regarded as the largest intelligence agency in the world in terms of sheer staff strength. No one even knows the official number of people employed by the agency, though according to one account, there may be over 10,000 people on its payroll, excluding informants, moles and general assets strewn around the globe. After successfully running assets in Kashmir and Punjab, with stints in the FIA and Military Intelligence, Afridi had been given charge of the ISI’s main division, Joint Intelligence X. The department coordinated with all other departments in the agency. Gathering, collating, structuring and processing intelligence and information from all other departments, JIX prepared the intelligence report for the director general of the ISI and subsequently, the president. Afridi had wanted to personally run Daniel Bradley and participate in the 26/11 operations in Mumbai but departmental politics had kept him out. He had now begun working with Chinese intelligence agencies. Afridi found Chinese intelligence to be much smarter, sharper and more efficient than the much hyped CIA, though he had friends in Langley as well. The Chinese, of course, were more than matched by the Mossad of Israel or the UK’s MI6. What Afridi liked about the Chinese was the basis of their alliance with Pakistan – thwarting India. They had been the first to refuse to recognize Bangladesh as a separate nation. It took years and a long process of diplomatic lobbying by the Indians for them to finally give in. Unsurprisingly, since the time Afridi joined the Pakistani army, he had begun working closely with them. It was with their help that the ISI had notched up consistent successes in north-east India. Major John Hu Wang had one of the shrewdest brains in the intelligence world. Wang’s ideologies were clear: Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh belonged to China, Pakistan was welcome to keep the rest. Both Wang and Afridi had made inroads into India. Even if Afridi could not participate in managing 26/11, he decided to continue with his private war against India. Within a couple of years of the Mumbai attacks, Afridi and Wang worked together to plant a Chinese research vessel disguised as a fishing… ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKSD5YI&location=1309))
- Afridi picked up the intercom and called his aide de camp, Major Sarfaraz Rashid. Rashid was not an army man. He had no grounding as an intelligence officer. Hired through the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) of Pakistan and primarily an academician and a linguist, Rashid had never fired a weapon in his life. Unlike his boss, he had something of a soft corner for India and loved Hindi movies and songs. A big fan of Dilip Kumar and Mohammad Rafi, in his free time he could be found downloading music and audio clips of film dialogues from Indian websites. ‘Ji, farmaiyye,’ he said, stepping into the cabin. The AC was motoring away at full blast on the lowest setting – sixteen degrees – and it was almost freezing. Afridi was smoking a cigar and looking out of his window. His face wore a dull, expressionless look and his eyes weren’t nearly as bright as usual. It was enough to worry Rashid. ‘Rashid, my friend,’ Afridi began calmly enough, before exploding, ‘how the fuck did we miss Maulana Umavi’s death? Why was I not informed about his trip to Turkey? Did he take the required permission? I thought he was well protected.’ ‘Sir, I will check …’ Rashid almost stammered. ‘Don’t check, get me his man Friday, ask him to fly down now. I want to see him before the end of the day. Is that understood?’ Rashid nodded limply. ([Location 1348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00RKSD5YI&location=1348))
