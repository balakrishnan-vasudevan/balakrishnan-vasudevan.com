## Highlights
- “If I had to pick one core psychological reason for his spying, I would target the experience he had in his relations with his father,” Charney said. “Hanssen’s father seemed to be fundamentally impatient with him.” His father, Charney concluded, was “borderline abusive.” Among the various punishments he imposed on his son, “he forced him to sit with his legs spread in some fashion. I’m not implying a sexual element to the abuse. But he was forced to sit in that position and it was humiliating.” ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=173))
- These accounts might be discounted as efforts to explain away Hanssen’s espionage by apportioning some of the blame to his dead father. In American society, people who commit crimes often seek to paint themselves as victims. Whether Hanssen’s treatment by his stern father was linked to his later betrayal of his country can be debated, but the relationship was without doubt a troubled one.

- In 1979, Hanssen had walked into the Amtorg office in Manhattan and offered his services to the GRU. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=354))
- Hanssen gave away no less than the identity of TOPHAT—the most important U.S. intelligence source inside the GRU. From his access to the FBI’s files, Hanssen was able to identify TOPHAT as the bureau’s code name for Dimitri Fedorovich Polyakov. At the time, Polyakov had been passing secrets to the United States for seventeen years. He was considered by Washington as an agent of supreme importance. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=359))
- He communicated with the GRU through encoded radio transmissions and through one-time pads, an unbreakable cipher system favored by the Russians. But of the various secrets Hanssen passed to the GRU, none compared to his betrayal of TOPHAT. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=369))
- It was Mabey who chose the name TOPHAT.* Polyakov said he was willing to spy for America because he felt his talents had gone unrecognized by the GRU. He provided Mabey with the names of four Americans who were spying for the Soviet Union.† ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=375))
- In Moscow, Polyakov used a high speed “burst” transmitter given to him by the CIA to radio messages from a streetcar traveling past the American embassy. He was also given a clock for his apartment in Moscow that lit up in response to a radio signal to inform him that a dead drop where he had left documents had been cleared by the CIA. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=387))
- Then, on June 13, at Chadwicks restaurant in Georgetown, Ames handed over the names of virtually every CIA intelligence source in the Soviet Union, sending ten to their execution and many others to prison. For this he was eventually paid $2.7 million by the KGB and promised another $1.9 million, for a total of $4.6 million. Among the names provided to the Russians by Ames were Valery Martynov and Sergei Motorin, the two secret FBI sources inside the Soviet embassy in Washington. But Ames also turned over the name of General Dimitri Fedorovich Polyakov of the GRU. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=398))
- “it was the excitement, and the idea of doing something really secret. You can’t believe what you are told about motivation anyway, because people don’t understand their own motivation. Martynov was intrigued by the game. He did not think spying for the Americans was wrong. Because he did not regard us as an enemy.” ([Location 686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=686))
- “He got into a wreck in his car with the hooker in the car,” said a former FBI agent. “The insurance adjustor tipped us off. That’s how it all started.” ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=692))
- Yuzhin revealed to American intelligence the existence of the KGB’s Group North, an elite unit of senior Soviet intelligence officers who specialized in recruiting American and Canadian targets worldwide. The KGB group was a kind of spy SWAT team with authority to travel anywhere on its missions. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=846))
- I warn that Mr. Boris Yuzhin (line PR, SF), Mr. Sergey Motorin (Line PR, Wash.) and Mr. Valeriy Martynov (Line X, Wash.) have been recruited by our “Special Services.” ([Location 884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=884))
- Having betrayed the three FBI sources and, as far as Hanssen knew, sent them to their doom, he described a classified intelligence collection program. In addition, “to further support my bona fides,” as Hanssen put it, he included information about recent Soviet defectors to U.S. intelligence. He added: ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=886))
- DROP LOCATION Please leave your package for me under the corner (nearest the street) of the wooden foot bridge located just west of the entrance to Nottoway Park. PACKAGE PREPARATION Use a green or brown plastic trash bag and trash to cover a waterproofed package. SIGNAL LOCATION Signal site will be the pictorial “pedestrian-crossing” signpost just west of the main Nottoway Park entrance on Old Courthouse Road. (The sign is the one nearest the bridge just mentioned.) SIGNALS My signal to you: One vertical mark of white adhesive tape meaning I am ready to receive your package. Your signal to me: One horizontal mark of white adhesive tape meaning drop filled. My signal to you: One vertical mark of white adhesive tape meaning I have received your package. (Remove old tape before leaving signal.) ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=922))
- In the spy trade, this schedule of meetings, drops, and dates is known as a communication plan. Six days later, on November ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=941))
- “If you wish to continue our discussions, please have someone run an advertisement in the Washington Times during the week of 1/12/87 or 1/19/87, for sale, ‘Dodge Diplomat, 1971, needs engine work, $1000.’ “Give a phone number and time-of-day in the advertisement where I can call,” Hanssen instructed. “I will call and leave a phone number where a recorded message can be left for me in one hour. I will say, ‘Hello, my name is Ramon. I am calling about the car you offered for sale in the Times.’ You will respond, ‘I’m sorry, but the man with the car is not here, can I get your number.’ The number will be in Area Code 212. I will not specify that Area Code on the line.” ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1091))
- In insisting on drops close to home, and often using the same drops many times, Hanssen was breaking all the traditional rules of spycraft. But he may not have done so merely for convenience; using hiding places nearby helped him to conceal his activities. It allowed him to exchange documents for cash on the way to or from work, avoiding longer absences that he might have to explain to his family. He could even tell his wife he was going to walk the dog. ([Location 1392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1392))
- Hanssen in the same November package also provided a summary of the secrets divulged to the CIA by Vitaly Yurchenko during his three-month interlude as a defector two years earlier. Since Aldrich Ames had been one of Yurchenko’s debriefers, the KGB already knew what secrets the defector had revealed; still, it was nice to get the information from a second mole. Also included in Hanssen’s package was a technical document describing COINS-II, the internal Internet used by the U.S. intelligence community to exchange information.† In ([Location 1438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1438))
- Hanssen’s letter, in addition to acknowledging the $20,000, provided detailed information about Victor Sheymov, an important Soviet defector to whose file he had access. He promised “a full report” on Sheymov “as soon as possible.” ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1446))
- In the same exchange, Hanssen also identified a KGB illegal in the United States, an officer operating without diplomatic cover, who had been recruited as a double agent by the FBI. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1455))
- In his package, Hanssen also included certain secret details about U.S. communications intelligence, describing just what Soviet traffic the NSA was unable to read. Along with several classified documents on paper, Hanssen for the first time enclosed a computer floppy disk on which he had downloaded additional secrets. ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1457))
- Hanssen included a particularly sensitive TOP SECRET report entitled “The FBI’s Double Agent Program.” The document was a detailed description of the FBI’s double agent operations worldwide over a ten-year period, including joint operations with other U.S. intelligence agencies. The report would have included everything learned by every American double agent over a decade. It would also have helped the KGB to weed out any fake walk-ins floated by the bureau to offer their services to the Russians. ([Location 1463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1463))
- more than 530 pages of documents, including a CIA analysis, classified TOP SECRET, of Soviet intelligence-gathering aimed at U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities. The CIA report evaluated how much Moscow knew about America’s early warning systems and about the nation’s ability to retaliate against a massive nuclear attack. Hanssen also turned over an even more highly classified 1987 document, prepared for the director of central intelligence, entitled “Compendium of Future Intelligence Requirements: Volume II.” This was a wish list of what the CIA wanted to know about the military strength of the Soviet Union and other countries, which thus amounted to a road map of what the CIA did not know. Hanssen also passed to the KGB a March 1988 CIA study classified SECRET and entitled “The Soviet Counterintelligence Offensive: KGB Recruitment Operations Against CIA.” The study of recruitment efforts aimed at the CIA contained a warning notice that read: “Intelligence Sources or Methods Involved (WNINTEL). National Security Information. Unauthorized Disclosure Subject to Criminal Sanctions.” Finally, Hanssen turned over the pièce de résistance, the study of Soviet penetrations of the FBI that he had personally directed and prepared with the assistance of Jim Milburn and Bob King. The KGB could now enjoy the product of this intensive effort by the FBI’s Soviet analytical unit. The study, classified TOP SECRET, identified the sources that had hinted at moles in the bureau, and exactly what each had said. ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1493))
- this one with information about the bureau’s technical surveillance operations, which of course Hanssen knew a great deal about, details of a new recruitment in New York City, and the identities of several other Soviets the FBI had targeted for recruitment attempts. The following month, the KGB informed Hanssen that another $50,000 had been placed in his Moscow bank account. ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1508))
- Hanssen hid a package with about three hundred pages of material, including FBI documents and a verbatim transcript of a meeting of the Counterintelligence Group.* ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1512))
- Included with a floppy disk and 356 pages of material were six recent National HUMINT Collection Plan (NHCP) documents. The acronym stands for human intelligence—information gathered by spies, as opposed to that collected by electronic or other technical means. ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1524))
- Was Hanssen’s religion, his constant preoccupation with God, a genuine expression of deep faith, or part of his cover as a Russian spy? Although some counterintelligence officials think Hanssen’s religion was a convenient cloak, those who knew him well disagree. True, his denunciation of “godless Communism” helped to throw off suspicion that he was on the payroll of the godless Communists. But Hanssen spent far too much time in his devotions, at church and with Opus Dei, and in long discussions about religion with his friends, for it all to have been a complete sham. ([Location 1670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1670))
- At the end of January, soon after the inauguration of the first President Bush, Hanssen left an emergency call-out signal for the KGB in the middle of downtown Washington, just above Dupont Circle at Connecticut Avenue and Q Street. The signal alerted the KGB to clear BOB, the drop in Idylwood Park, and it did so immediately. Hanssen had left a package there with a copy of a cable and a note reading: “Send to the Center right away. This might be useful.” ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1712))
- Although the term is little known to the public, MASINT, which stands for measurement and signature intelligence, applies to a wide variety of data scooped up by satellites and by secret sensors around the globe and under the seas. MASINT includes, for example, satellites equipped with gamma ray trackers and X-ray spectrometers to measure radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion, as well as infrared sensors to detect antiballistic missile tests. It includes powerful phased array radars, such as COBRA DANE at Shemya, Alaska, which was built to watch for a possible Soviet missile attack and measure Soviet missile test launches. And MASINT includes as well the hundreds of hydrophones planted on the ocean floor in a program called SOSUS to measure the distinctive acoustic signature of Soviet (now Russian) submarines. The document passed to the KGB by Hanssen was significant because it reflected the consensus of the intelligence community on the secret operations and goals of the MASINT program. The report was crammed with specifics and highly technical information.* Hanssen must have been unusually nervous about transmitting it to the KGB, because for the first and only time he asked that it be returned. Typically there would be numbered copies of a highly classified report of this nature; Hanssen would have a difficult time explaining why the copy he had removed had vanished if he did not get it back. ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1724))
- It was no ordinary bug. Peter Karlow, a CIA officer in charge of the agency’s technical staff, recalled the problems the experts faced. “We found it and we didn’t know how it worked,” Karlow said. “There was a passive device inside the seal, like a tadpole, with a little tail. The Soviets had a microwave signal beamed at the embassy that caused the receptors inside the seal to resonate. It had no current, no batteries, and an infinite life expectancy.” The CIA’s unsuccessful attempt to copy the bug was code-named EASY CHAIR.† ([Location 1852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=1852))
- Following standard KGB procedure for illegals, he had acquired the birth certificate in Finland of the real Reino Gikman, who was probably long dead, and stepped into his skin. ([Location 2055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2055))
- Around 1986, Gikman was said to have been spotted by Austrian military counterintelligence entering the back door of the Soviet embassy in Vienna. This information made its way to the CIA, which opened a file on Reino Gikman and began tracking his activities. ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2062))
- Early in March, he passed to Moscow secret data about four Soviets who were FBI or CIA sources—a KGB officer, a Soviet illegal, and two defectors.* That raised to ten the number of sources whom he had identified, including the three who were executed. Before Hanssen’s espionage career came to an end with his arrest, he had betrayed an astonishing fifty human sources or recruitment targets. In addition to those who were executed, a number of others were imprisoned after he provided their names to the Russians. ([Location 2388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2388))
- In May, Hanssen turned over more than two hundred pages of documents. He also informed the KGB that he was about to be promoted and would be traveling for a year. The Russians gave him another $35,000 and asked that along with any “especially hot” material he include “guidance” on what the KGB might use and act upon without pointing back to him and endangering his security. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2396))
- Certainly the KGB did not want to risk losing such a valuable source, but at the same time the request may have had the dual purpose of flattering Hanssen and making him feel in control. ([Location 2398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2398))
- Dear Friend: Congratulations on Your promotion. We wish You all the very best in Your life and career.… Your friendship and understanding are very important to us.… We don’t see any problem for the system of our future communications in regard to this new circumstances of Yours. Though we can’t but regret that our contacts may be not so regular as before, like You said. We believe our current commo plan … covers ruther [sic] flexibly Your needs: You may have a contact with us anytime You want after staying away as long as You have to. So, do Your new job, make Your trips, take Your time. The commo plan we have will still be working. We’ll keep covering the active call out signal site no matter how long it’s needed. And we’ll be in a ready-to-go mode to come over to the drop next in turn whenever You are ready: that is when You are back home and decide to communicate. All You’ll have to do is to put Your call out signal, just as now. And You have two addresses to use to recontact us only if the signal sites for some reason don’t work or can’t be used.… But in any case be sure: You may have a contact anytime because the active call out site is always covered according to the schedule no matter how long you’ve been away.… Thank You and good luck. Sincerely,      Your friends. ([Location 2403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2403))
- Hanssen did not contact the KGB again until February 1991, when he left an emergency call-out signal. In a message at CHARLIE, he revealed that the FBI’s chief of counterintelligence in New York had told him that the bureau had recruited a certain number of Soviet sources, presumably at the Soviet mission to the UN. And in passing, he remarked that the $40,000 he had received was “too generous.” ([Location 2455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2455))

- The technically minded Hanssen also proposed a new communications system to replace the cumbersome dead drops, the plastic bags squirreled away under footbridges, and all that unpleasant slogging around in the dark in the mud. As Hanssen outlined it, he would set up an office somewhere in Washington that would not be tapped or bugged by the FBI, since the bureau would be unaware of it. There, he and the KGB could communicate directly by computer, using special equipment with advanced encryption technology. ([Location 2546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2546))
- But Hanssen did not reply. What the KGB had feared all along now happened. Their apprehension was always there in the background; it could be sensed between the lines of their warm and fuzzy letters to Hanssen. It was the fear that one day he would simply disappear. As often as the Russians might drive by the emergency call-out site near Dupont Circle, there were no chalk marks, no sign that their man was ready for another exchange of money and secrets. As often as they checked their mail at the accommodation addresses in Alexandria, there was no word from “Ramon Garcia,” no more letters from “Jim Baker” or “G. Robertson.” Robert Hanssen had gone to ground. ([Location 2551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2551))

- *The four were described this way in the FBI’s affidavit. The term defector is ambiguous because it normally means an intelligence officer who escapes from his country and asks for political asylum from another government. But in this instance—since the KGB would know who had left the Soviet Union and gone over to the West—it might refer to a defector or agent in place, someone who remains on the job but provides information to U.S. intelligence. ([Location 2568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2568))

- According to Galey, Hanssen was always trying to improve her spiritual life, continually urging her to go to church. He would ask, “What are you planning to do with the rest of your life? Are you getting any closer to God?” But, she said, although she passed a church every day on her way to Joanna’s, “I felt it was hypocritical for me to go to church and then go down to the club and take my clothes off.” ([Location 2611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2611))
- She added, “Hanssen considered women beneath him. He spoke down to them. But if he wanted to rub up against me he would. And the bureau is a boys’ club.” ([Location 2764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2764))
- Hanssen explained to his FBI and CIA debriefers that his reemergence in 1993 was the result of overwhelming curiosity, to which he succumbed. It was a curiosity about what had happened to information he had previously passed to Moscow. At least twice, Hanssen had provided the KGB with a complete roster of the FBI’s double agent (DA) cases. Typically, in these operations, an American military enlisted man or officer under FBI control would offer secrets to Soviet military intelligence. One frequent goal would be to see what secrets the Russians asked the double agent to obtain. That in turn would indicate what Moscow did not know. Conversely, the questions that were not asked might suggest what the Russians already knew. It was these double agent operations that led to Hanssen’s fleeting, risky attempt to recontact the GRU, because it was the GRU that the FBI had targeted in these cases. ([Location 2862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2862))

- The FBI opened an investigation to try to determine the identity of the man who had, in Deep Throat fashion, approached the Russian spy in the parking garage. But there was very little to go on, and the case went nowhere. This was noted with relief and satisfaction by Hanssen, who closely followed the progress of the investigation in the FBI’s internal computer system. ([Location 2878](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2878))

- Through his work on the nuclear issue, he developed a close friendship with Barton A. Borrasca, the CIA’s specialist on how Pakistan was financing its nuclear weapons program. If Robert Hanssen could be said to have had a groupie in the U.S. intelligence world, it was Bart Borrasca, who became an unabashed admirer of the FBI agent. They had met in the early 1990s. At the time, Hanssen was no longer funneling secrets to the KGB. He was still working at FBI headquarters as chief of the threat list unit. ([Location 2908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2908))
- “Borrasca worked in the Transfer Networks Group at NPC,” said one agency colleague. “They focused on unraveling all the shipping and financial networks used by proliferating countries. They were trying to figure out where to put pressure to stop that activity. They studied how countries were moving money and nuclear technology. Borrasca was the Pak guy; he was responsible for Pakistan.” ([Location 2918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2918))

- At the time, the great puzzle in the affair was how the KGB had known to warn Bloch that he was in danger. What Bamford did not then know, of course, was that Hanssen was a Russian spy, the very one who had tipped off the KGB to the fact that Bloch was under investigation by the FBI. ([Location 2983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=2983))
- Late in 1986, Gardner R. “Gus” Hathaway, then the CIA’s counterintelligence chief, appointed Jeanne R. Vertefeuille to head a special task force to find the penetration who was destroying the agency’s Soviet assets. A short, gray-haired, grandmotherly woman with glasses, Vertefeuille was so unlikely-looking a counterspy that she might have been chosen by central casting for dramatic irony. But Vertefeuille had an encyclopedic knowledge of KGB cases, and it was her mole hunt unit that eventually pinpointed Ames as the spy. ([Location 3031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3031))
- When it was learned in 1986 that Valery Martynov and Sergei Motorin, the two FBI assets in the Soviet embassy in Washington, had been arrested in Moscow and were to be executed, the bureau formed a six-person team to try to learn how the two had been detected. James T. “Tim” Caruso, a counterintelligence supervisor at FBI headquarters, was appointed head of the task force. A tall, intense New Yorker with thinning red hair, Caruso named the task force ANLACE, after a tapered medieval dagger. Counterintelligence is painstaking work; fourteen years were to go by before it was understood that the two Soviet assets had been betrayed by both Ames and Hanssen. ([Location 3039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3039))
- She had once carpooled with Ames and was struck by how his personality had changed when he came back from Rome sporting expensive Italian suits and capped teeth. It was Grimes who ultimately zeroed in on Ames by comparing the deposits in his bank account to the dates of his lunches with Sergei D. Chuvakhin, a Soviet diplomat in Washington. Ames had official approval to meet the Russian, whom he was supposedly cultivating for the CIA; but Grimes discovered that either on the same day as or the day after each lunch with Chuvakhin, Ames deposited large sums of money in his bank account. She realized then that the mole had to be Ames. ([Location 3047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3047))
- In the highest councils of the CIA and the FBI, however, the arrest of Aldrich Ames in 1994 brought only a fleeting sense of relief. As the damage assessment of the Ames case proceeded, it quickly became apparent that his actions—the betrayal of the CIA’s entire Soviet network—could not explain all of the puzzles still haunting the two agencies. There were a number of anomalies, as such unexplained events are known in the intelligence world, but the one that still loomed largest was the Felix Bloch case. ([Location 3061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3061))
- Somehow the KGB had been able to warn Bloch that he was in danger. And Aldrich Ames had not known about the FBI investigation of Bloch. He did not have access to the case. In the late spring of 1989, when someone had alerted the KGB to the FBI surveillance of Bloch, Ames was winding up a three-year tour in Rome. ([Location 3065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3065))
- Details are the essence of counterintelligence, and spycatchers must pay close attention to details if they are to prevail. The troublesome facts of the Bloch case could not be ignored. ([Location 3068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3068))
- In the 1980s, Jeanne Vertefeuille had not initially been given the resources she needed to run the CIA’s search for the penetration; as time passed, the agency seemed to have other priorities. It was Paul J. Redmond, a senior CIA counterintelligence officer, who was credited with reviving the mole hunt that in 1994 resulted in the FBI’s successful surveillance and arrest of Aldrich Ames. Within weeks of Ames’s capture, Redmond had set up a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) as a follow-on to the mole hunt unit. ([Location 3083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3083))
- Pelton, Howard, and Yurchenko. ([Location 3096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3096))
- He was Earl Edwin Pitts, an FBI counterintelligence agent who spied for the KGB in New York for five years, between 1987 and 1992, and was paid $124,000. He turned over to the Soviets details of FBI counterintelligence operations against the Russians. The Russian defector, Rollan G.

- While the mole hunters were wrapping up these high-profile spy cases, the CIA and the FBI were slowly working their way through a bureaucratic maze known inside the CIA as “the A-to-Z list.” The list was a direct fallout from the Ames case. The Counterespionage Group and CIA’s Office of Security (OS) were reviewing a huge backlog of polygraph tests to make sure another mole was not lurking somewhere inside Langley. It was a tedious, time-consuming job. “The A-to-Z list had about three hundred people who had SPRs,” said one CIA official. “Significant Physiological Responses on the polygraph. Some of those on the list had nothing to do with CI. Some had contacts with foreign nationals. Several dozen were referred to the bureau, as required by law. The vast majority were sorted out by the Office of Security.” ([Location 3168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3168))
- The SVR’s message reviewed the signals, the strips of white adhesive tape that they and Hanssen were to use on the post by the park sign. Hanssen’s tape was to be vertical, the SVR’s horizontal, just as before. Then, in case he had become rusty from lack of practice, his handlers added: “After you will clear the drop don’t forget to remove our tape that will mean for us—exchange is over.” ([Location 3395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3395))

- The SVR also proposed a new signal site in one of Washington’s most exclusive residential neighborhoods, an electric utility pole at the intersection of Foxhall Road and Whitehaven Parkway. In the same letter, the Russians also suggested it was time to move on from adhesive tape to thumbtacks, and they went into extraordinary detail about the size and color, even telling Hanssen what drugstore chain carried the right ones: At any working day put a white thumb tack (1 cm in diameter, colored sets are sold at CVS) into the Northern side of the pole at the height of about 1.2 yards. The tack must be seen from a car going down Foxhall Road. This will mean for us that we shall retrieve your package from the DD [dead drop] Foxstone Park at the evening of the nex [sic] week’s Tuesday (when it’s getting dark). In case of a threatening situation of any kind put a yellow tack at the same place. This will mean that we shall refrain from any communication with you until further notice from your side (the white tack). Apparently, five months went by before Hanssen heard from the Russians again, and judging by the letter he sent on March 14, 2000, he was becoming unglued.

- “When code clerks had arrived, when the pouch was sent to Moscow, little things that might indicate something big going on.” Then, as the mole hunters focused on particular possible suspects, they could turn to Rochford’s study. “We would look to see if there was anything corresponding with the suspects’ lives that would explain intense activity in the residency.” Just such wisps, strands, and tiny details are the tools of counterintelligence. Often, the microscopic attention to detail ends in frustration and turns up nothing. “The Cherkashin study did not lead directly to Hanssen,” the FBI man said, “but it eliminated some suspicions.” ([Location 3607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3607))

- Kelley was well known in the counterintelligence world, for he had built his career as a specialist in illegals, the Russian spies sent to the West without benefit of diplomatic cover. Kelley had headed the illegals group at the CIA. His was an arcane, difficult specialty, because illegals are rarely detected. They do not pose as diplomats and often steal the identities of long dead or living persons—they can be anybody. It was Kelley who was credited with unmasking Reino Gikman, the KGB illegal who turned up in Vienna when Felix Bloch was deputy chief of mission. And it was Gikman, metamorphosing into “Pierre Bart,” who dined in Paris with Bloch in mid-May 1989 and left with the airline bag that Bloch had placed under the table. It was Gikman as well who had called Bloch a month later to warn him of “a contagious disease.” ([Location 3681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3681))

- And it was precisely because Kelley had broken the Bloch case that he fell under suspicion. When the mole hunters hunt, they construct a matrix, matching the nature of the secrets believed to have been compromised with the names of the people who had access to those secrets. Then they attempt to winnow down the list, eliminating the names, for example, of those whose access might have occurred only after the suspected date that the information leaked.

The Gs are a special team of surveillance experts, selected to look like ordinary citizens. A young mother with a baby in a stroller, joggers, street repair crews in hard hats, an old man with a cane, telephone linemen, white-haired grandmothers with shopping bags, young lovers necking in the park—all may be Gs on the job.* “The Gs were on him for a long time,” one former FBI man said.

- it was the nature of counterintelligence. Unmasking a mole is a difficult business. The job of the counterspies is to suspect everyone and trust no one.

- Mike Rochford knew something about how important real documents and files could be. In 1992, after being turned away by the CIA, Vasili Mitrokhin had defected to MI6, the British secret intelligence service, with an unprecedented trove of documents he had copied while working as the chief archivist inside the KGB. The British had whisked him to London and given him a new identity.* Rochford, often with Bob Wade, a veteran FBI counterspy, had flown to London a dozen times during a two-year period to debrief Mitrokhin about the materials. Mitrokhin’s files revealed dozens of previously unknown KGB operations and unmasked two spies. ([Location 3977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3977))

- That condition was one of the first hurdles to be overcome, and it was a major one, because the FBI insisted that the Russian relinquish the file before he was paid. The bureau was not about to buy a pig in a poke. “He wanted the money up front,” one FBI source said. “The guy said he could get a tape recording with the mole’s voice, but he didn’t know who he is. It sounded fishy. Is this guy trying to scam us? ‘This is going to be a dynamite tape,’ he says.” A tape recording! Now the FBI agents wanted to get their hands on the file more than ever. But the Russian had to be persuaded to turn over the file first, and to trust the U.S. government to keep its commitments if the file, upon analysis, proved to be what he said it was. ([Location 3990](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=3990))
- The ex-KGB officer would then need to get out of Russia, with as many family members as possible. He would surely be imprisoned or shot if the SVR discovered what he had done. There were details to be worked out about his life in the United States. He would have to be given a new identity, his personal safety and that of his family guaranteed for life. It would not be enough to settle him into a seaside mansion in La Jolla or some other pleasant spot; he would have to feel certain he was beyond the reach of the SVR. True, the KGB reportedly gave up assassinations more than two decades ago, but defectors, even if they do not spend every moment looking over their shoulder for a hit man from Moscow, are never entirely free of concerns about their security. Officials were extraordinarily tight-lipped about many of the details involved in acquiring the file and getting it out of Russia.* But when, as planned, the former KGB man returned to Moscow after the negotiations in New York, the CIA established contact with him. When all the arrangements were complete, it was to the CIA that the Russian turned over the file. Early in November 2000, the file, carefully guarded every moment of its clandestine journey from Moscow, arrived at FBI headquarters in Washington. According to a senior bureau official, “It came in one package, which was actually several smaller packages, all of which would fit into a medium-sized suitcase.” The file was able to fit into such a relatively small space because much of the material was on computer floppy disks. Everything was taken immediately to the FBI laboratory on the third floor. The first order of business was a forensic examination of the file. The documents were carefully dusted for fingerprints, but there were no useful prints on them or on the floppy disks. Then every document, envelope, and disk was photographed. One of the packages came with a note that said, “Don’t open this.” The FBI counterintelligence agents were itching to open it and overwhelmed with curiosity, but they waited. In a few weeks, they knew, the Russian would come out of Moscow and explain the mystery package. In the meantime, there was work to be done. There were translations needed; some of the material was in Russian. For example, the KGB man had managed to compile an inventory and description in Russian of every document—six thousand pages in all—that had been passed to Moscow by the mole; the list would have to be translated back into English. The file included the letters exchanged by the Russians and the mole over the course of fifteen years, some on computer disks, and many of the titles of the documents he had given to the KGB. The actual documents that the mole had passed to the Russians were not included in the package from Moscow. But the detailed notes taken by the KGB man described the documents in sufficient detail so that the FBI could retrieve them from its own files, as well as from the files of the NSA and the CIA.

- The bureau knew that Hanssen would appear at Foxstone Park that Sunday because it had found on his computer memory storage card the July 2000 letter from the SVR designating ELLIS as the dead drop to be used once a year on February 18.* And the FBI thought it knew exactly when he would show up at the park: when agents had searched Hanssen’s Palm III computer, they found a reference to “ELLIS,” February 18, and 8 P.M.

- *In SVR parlance, this was a so-called iron site, a fixed location (i.e., one made of iron) to be used on a specified date every year. If all other means of communication should fail, the agent knows he can always make recontact at the iron site. *The FBI concluded that the money had been left at the LEWIS drop site as a result of a breakdown in communication between the SVR and Hanssen. Normally, Hanssen and the Russians exchanged documents and money at the same drop site. Weather may have been partly to blame. “When the Russians placed the fifty thousand dollars at the amphitheater [at LEWIS], they put a piece of tape on a pole,” Gallagher said. “It rained, the tape shriveled up and fell off the pole. We found it about two feet away.” ([Location 4492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4492))
- He fit into no known previous category of spies. He was not motivated entirely by money, and certainly not by ideology. James Woolsey, the former director of the CIA, conceded he was baffled by Hanssen. “If you look at a hundred or so cases of Americans who spied for Russia, you don’t have many ideological motives, as in the case of Philby or the Rosenbergs. You do have a few people who spy for ethnic or religious reasons—Larry Wu-Tai Chin, Pollard—but they are very small in number. Almost all are white guys. They break into two groups. Flaky young types, as in The Falcon and the Snowman, smoke a little grass, and hey, let’s steal some secrets.* The other is the classic Aldrich Ames, the middle-aged guy in midlife crisis. Benedict Arnold was the same as Ames, both with new wives and a midlife crisis. This guy [Hanssen] is outside any of those patterns. He is not ethnic, not ideological, not a young guy who’s flaky, and doesn’t appear to be in a midlife crisis, despite the ([Location 4840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4840))
- stripper. Everything is bottled up inside. It is truly odd.” Because Hanssen’s character was so contradictory and complex, the extraordinary story of his more than two decades of espionage cannot be understood fully without exploring his motives and trying to fathom Hanssen himself. What drove him into such a dark place? Dr. David L. Charney, the psychiatrist whom Plato Cacheris engaged to evaluate Hanssen, visited the spy in the Alexandria jail more than thirty times over many months. They met privately in a small, vaultlike room with white cinder-block walls and a camera, but no guards or other persons present.* Hanssen spoke freely to Dr. Charney about his childhood, his family, his FBI career, his spying, his religion, and his motives for betraying his country. As a result, Charney probably learned more about the experiences and influences that formed Hanssen, and his motives to spy, than anyone else in the world.

- David Charney, who had previously spent time with Earl Pitts, the second convicted spy in the FBI’s history, is a soft-spoken New Yorker whose psychiatric practice is based in Alexandria. He has in the past been a consultant to the CIA. At the time he evaluated Hanssen, he was also working on a paper on the psychology of spies that he hoped would help the government to better protect itself against them. Charney identified several factors that led Hanssen to become a spy for Moscow. Many of these were raised by Hanssen himself in his often-weekly meetings with the psychiatrist. But Charney had a word of caution. “People are complicated beings and motivations are multidetermined and evolve over time,” he said. “Motives may get altered in memory, depending on rationalizations that people bring in explaining themselves to themselves.” Having said that, Charney affirmed that Hanssen himself pointed to “financial pressure” as one of the reasons he first crossed the line into espionage. To understand the motivation for espionage, Charney said, it is crucial to look at the six months leading up to when a spy first crosses that line. Nor can money be discounted as a continuing motive. For someone on the salary of a midlevel federal employee, the $600,000 that the Russians paid to Hanssen with the promise of another $800,000 is not inconsequential. Hanssen remodeled his house in Virginia at a cost of $70,000, sent six kids to private school, four to college, all of them to the orthodontist. He collected an armory of guns, all sorts of computers and related gadgetry, and spent some $80,000 on the stripper, including a sapphire-and-diamond necklace, the trip to Hong Kong, and a Mercedes, albeit used. It would be simplistic, however, to say that Hanssen only… ([Location 4859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4859))
- According to Charney, Hanssen really wanted money for one reason: to assure his wife that he was not a failure. “Men are burdened by masculine pride. We put our public face into the world and want to be respected by our fellow men and by ourselves. The person we allow into our most intimate knowledge of our life is our wife. If our wife thinks we are an asshole, we have no protection. We have a chink ([Location 4882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4882))
- in our armor; if our wife thinks we are a loser that is intolerable. “Bonnie was the one person who brought light into his life. She was the last person he would want to think he was a failure. He reached to prove to her he was a good provider and a good husband. So that when she would express wishes for various things he would always buy them for her. He felt it was necessary to sustain his image in her eyes as successful. That put him into a financial corner, because he agreed to take on various financial burdens, like buying a house out of his reach financially, in Scarsdale. ([Location 4884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4884))
- Aside from the money, many of Hanssen’s colleagues in the FBI, including the friends he made there, strongly believed that Hanssen was motivated to spy because he was excluded from the inner club of counterintelligence agents and relegated to the back room. “Bob was always seen as a computer guy, a weenie, a number cruncher,” said David Major. “He was somebody you want on your team, to use. He was never going to lead the team. Don Stukey would be a quarterback, Bob’s always on the sidelines; he would analyze the plays and know what they did right or wrong, but he would never get on the playing field.” Jim Ohlson reached much the same conclusion about his friend. “Although Hanssen was involved with and fascinated by CI and Soviet operations, he was never in the core group that actually conducted them. He may have felt excluded, his skills unappreciated. He had longed to be involved in spy work—so he turned to another government to do it. “Hanssen had great respect for the KGB and its professionalism. He once said, ‘They’re the only target I want to work against. They’re the only enemy worth fighting.’ So he was drawn to the KGB.” ([Location 4893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4893))
- A. Jackson Lowe, Hanssen’s boss on his second New York tour, in the mid-1980s, also remembered him as an outsider. “He never got the respect he thought he deserved. There were always other agents out front getting the glory. Here was a guy who was very bright, he felt like he was not well accepted, an outcast. He did not fit in.” As a perennial outsider, Hanssen may have decided to create his own Soviet operation. The feeling of being excluded, combined with his self-image, at least partly justified, as a person of superior intellect and technical gifts, could have created bitterness, a desire to “show them.” And underlying his decision to spy may have been a grandiose belief he could never be caught because he was too clever. If Hanssen’s resentment over being excluded led to his spying, however, he did not say that to Charney. He did tell the psychiatrist that “he came to think of himself as an outsider, a nerd.” But Hanssen did not link that to his espionage. Instead, Hanssen spent a good deal of time talking about his father. “In the very first meeting we had, that was the very first topic that he brought up,” Charney recalled. “You see this often in people. Troubled relationships with a father will affect their thinking for the rest of their life. Hanssen’s father was a difficult father to grow up under, a strong personality. He was not a warm, mentoring person. Hanssen was an only child and his father did not hold him much in esteem. His father had very little time for him.” ([Location 4910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4910))
- “When a boy grows up without effective fathering, it leaves a tremendous empty place, a father hunger. Boys want to be welcomed into adult manhood by their fathers. If they don’t get that, they are always feeling uneasy, not a true member of the club of men. That is one of the things that happened with Hanssen. He was belittled and made to feel inadequate. And yet he loved his father, he worshipped his father. That is not an unusual thing. The very person that abuses you is so powerful that one is in awe of that person.” At the same time, Charney said, Hanssen was “infuriated” with his father, his anger deep-seated and intense. Because he feared his father, however, “he had to bottle it up. He used the phrase ‘bottled up’ a lot. But now and then the cork would come out of the bottle. Not so much as a kid but as an adult. At a certain point he would blow like a volcano. ([Location 4925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4925))

- “At some point he decides, ‘It can be done and somebody like me can do it.’ He knows all the cases, how people who spied against the U.S. were caught. And so he crosses the line. Once he got going he set out to be the best spy ever. He’s trying to commit the perfect crime. He’s really excessive in what he passes. In his day job he’s being very helpful to the FBI. “He’s getting money he can’t spend very well, and he’s getting satisfaction he can’t share with anyone. In the letters you see him forming a relationship with the Russians. The only people he can share his success with are the people on the other side.” David Charney, too, concluded that Hanssen spied, at least to an extent, because he wanted to peer inside the opposition. “The spying he did was partly out of curiosity: how did the KGB actually operate as opposed to how the FBI thought they operated? How would you ever know that if you did not get involved with them? He would give lectures, brilliant lectures, on how the KGB operated. Because he really knew. He knew better than anybody.” ([Location 4981](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4981))
- To many of his colleagues, Hanssen projected an irritating sense of superiority. That may have stemmed not only from his belief that he was smarter than others, but from his secret knowledge that he was a Russian spy, the spy who at one point directed the very study of moles in the FBI, so that he was looking for himself. ([Location 4989](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=4989))

- “I think a spy is the loneliest person in the world,” Charney said. “The handlers of spies know this and know how to play them like a violin.” That was certainly true of the KGB and the SVR, whose letters to Hanssen shamelessly played on his psychological need for their friendship and recognition. (“Your superb sense of humor and Your sharp-asa-razor mind. We highly appreciate both.” And so on.) The mind of Robert Hanssen, which Charney explored with the author, was also a subject of great interest to American intelligence. By early 2002, the CIA was preparing a psychological profile of Hanssen as part of the damage assessment headed by former CIA counterintelligence expert Paul Redmond. ([Location 5034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=5034))
- The purpose of the secret study was to try to identify those characteristics of Hanssen that might help intelligence agencies to spot potential traitors in the future. But Hanssen was so unusual a spy, his motives so mixed and complex, that one could only wish the CIA good luck in trying to draw universal conclusions from its study of the most damaging spy in the history of the FBI. The profilers attempting to understand the mind of Robert Hanssen were embarking on a voyage to the dark side of the moon. ([Location 5042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=5042))
- It is a lot easier to catch a spy with the benefit of hindsight. Hanssen took care in his lifestyle not to draw attention to himself. He tooled around in an old Taurus, not a Jaguar, drank very little, and seemed outwardly a deeply religious, model family man, content to live a placid middle-class life in the Virginia suburbs. Despite these precautions, Hanssen, contrary to popular belief, was far from the perfect spy. He was clever to try to conceal his identity from the Russians, but he made all sorts of mistakes, from repeated use of the same dead drops, whatever his rationale for doing so, to all the clues to his identity that he dropped like a trail of bread crumbs in his messages to Moscow. He even left incriminating letters to the Russians on his computer card in FBI headquarters. ([Location 5093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=5093))
- As an experienced counterintelligence agent, Hanssen knew that his greatest risk was that he might, at any time, be turned in by an equivalent FBI or CIA mole inside the KGB. In the end, that was his undoing. The risk of such exposure is why both Hanssen and Ames betrayed Martynov and Motorin, the two FBI sources inside the KGB’s Washington residency. The best way for a mole to protect himself is to betray and thereby kill the other side’s mole. Hanssen’s friend Paul Moore summed up the stakes well. “The better you are, the more incentive for someone on to the other side to sell you out. The problem is that once you’re in the game, you’re in the game for life, and you’re betting your life all the time. “The only way you can get away with it is to die before U.S. counterintelligence finds you, because they will look for you and they will eventually get to you, because what you’re doing is really dumb. The more successful you are, the more valuable it is to the U.S. to find you, and the more salable you are to somebody on the other side. Bob was playing smart moves at a very dumb game and he did not get away with it.” ([Location 5099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004SOVCBA&location=5099))

But if there is a pantheon of spies, certainly Hanssen would have to take his place in it, alongside such celebrated moles as Kim Philby and Aldrich Ames.
