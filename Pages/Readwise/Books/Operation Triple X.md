- What fault lines could he exploit in the post-war scenario? Tap the Sindhis? Incite the Seraikis? Provoke the Pakhtoons? Arm the Baluchis? Exploit the Baltistanis? Turn the Afghans against Islamabad? ([Location 1734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=1734))
- So, as I was telling you,” Bhagat continued, “for your cover, our story runs like this: Harfan Bukhari, the seven-year-old lad managed to escape the slaughter and was restored to his phufi (paternal aunt). A woman in her fifties, Harfan’s aunt, and her husband lived in one of the blind lanes of the walled city of Delhi… “Their nightmare wasn’t yet over. Her husband was cut to pieces in the communal carnage of 1950 and she just managed to run up the stairs of the Jama Masjid, with you. The old lady had no means to bear the expenses for migrating and no neighbour was kind enough to pick her up. In the second exodus too, from either side of the gory border, each one was on his own.” “Didn’t she get in touch with her brother in Karachi?” asked Ramendra. “She didn’t like to desert the memories of her husband, and Shamim’s second wife didn’t encourage her. The blackest nightmare came to an end, the blood and flesh were washed clean, and the old lady started a new life. She brought up Harfan, educated him, and died three years ago. Harfan, a bitter enemy of the Hindus and India, has now decided to go over to Pakistan. His goal is to trace out his uncle and live as an honourable and proud Muslim, in the country of his destiny.” “Why are you telling me this story?” “This is your basic cover story, the story of Harfan Bukhari. Here are copies of few letters you had written to your uncle Shamim and his replies. These are your certificates from Aligarh Muslim University. Your uncle is keen to see you and wants you to join him in his business. Here’s a pamphlet. This contains details of the Bukhari family tree. Mug it up.” “I didn’t write any letter.” “We’ve done the job for you. You are now supposed to be a resident of Umerkot in Sind. Read the letters and keep yourself updated, your uncle is expecting you.” “But, I’m a Hindu! How can you forge my birth certificate, school documents and how can you change my physical features?” Kaushal looked up in disbelief. “You’ll be given all the training necessary to be a good Muslim. We’d take care. Here’s another pamphlet. It contains all details about your real father’s well-wishers back in Jhumra. Some Muslim families are still loyal to him.” “Who are these characters?” “Find out for yourself.” “Mother never spoke about such people back in Pakistan.” “Don’t quiz her if she hasn’t. She can’t be a privy to your new life and assignment.” Back to the car, Ramendra Kaushal lighted a cigarette, inhaled a few puffs, and shot back.

- “Don’t worry. Ram Karan is an enemy of the nation. You’ll have opportunity to score even with him. You can achieve anything if you wish. Let’s go. We drive straight to Delhi. Maulana Rizwan shall be waiting for you.” ([Location 1988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=1988))
- “Aren’t the Pakis going to tear down my cover in no time?” Ramendra asked. “We’ll teach you all the tricks needed to merge in the new milieu. The Pakis can’t get at you, if you live by the rules. That’s important.” Bhagat turned the wheels towards Delhi. “It’s scary.” “A… ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=1993))
- Shyam Purohit alias Maulana Rizwan, FIB’s cornerstone in Islamic studies and agent moulding for Islam and Pakistan related operations, functioned from a nondescript building located in the wilderness of rural Delhi. The sprawling wooded farmhouse, camouflaged behind cowsheds, chicken coops, and a flourishing fruit… ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=1996))
- The stray shepherds and tribal hunter-gatherers knew Maulana Rizwan as an ardent religious Muslim peer (saint) and a humble owner of the poultry-cum-dairy farm. He usually dressed as a village maulana and flaunted a flourishing moustache and beard with a white mosque cap to match. Proficient in Urdu, Arabic, and Persian, Rizwan was an alem, maulana and mufti, all rolled in one. He took years to perfect the cover. He frequented nearby Muslim villages to perform nikah (marriage) ceremonies and other religious rituals. He wasn’t known as a social creature. However, he did not fail to show up for the Friday prayers at the historic Jama Masjid and ijtema (religious teaching) congregations organised by the Tablighi Jammat and Rabita-al-Alam-al-Islami, the Saudi based fountainhead of proselytising missions. Shyam Purohit was both a legend and an icon in the FIB. Recruited way back in 1950, the genesis of his tryst with the intelligence fraternity had actually started very back in 1948. The FIB was presented with a giant-sized problem soon after the transfer of power. The Muslim officers had opted for Pakistan and those who preferred to… ([Location 1999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=1999))
- hatred and distrust still haunted the noblest of souls, both Hindu and Muslim. The Partition left the FIB almost crippled. The Muslims, a suspect community in Hindu majority India, had shut all the windows and the Hindus in turn treated them as poisoned cheese balls. The age-old communication links had snapped. Rabindra Narayan Dutta had conceived the idea of creating Muslim clones in FIB’s in-house laboratory. Enterprising talents staffed it. Shyam Purohit was one such early talent, trained to don a complete Muslim cover. Son of a Gujarat Brahmin and a promising officer, he learnt Arabic, Urdu and mastered the Quran Majid and Hadith, all the technicalities of Namaj, Qalma and intricacies of personal law. He passed the test of all tests by undergoing the process of circumcision. Shyam Purohit trained as a hardliner Muslim fundamentalist had infiltrated deep into the targeted Islamic religious and political bodies. In his new incarnation, bearing the lofty name of Maulana Rizwan, he had accomplished the task of spawning several intelligence hatcheries inside the Islamic Jamaat. He had cloned himself through the process of rigorous training and helped the FIB in churning out deep penetration agents inside Islamic organisations.… ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=2014))
- Muhim alias Gautam Rai was earlier infiltrated into the Deoband School of Islamic studies, the alma mater… ([Location 2028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=2028))
- Muhim took over after breakfast with lessons in Urdu. The Alsatians snoozed under the mid-summer heat, intermittently sniffing Kaushal's exposed limbs. "This is the most important part of the job." Muhim pontificated. “Every bloody step is important. But remove these devils first. They don't help in remembering the queer alphabets." ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=2048))
- "Son, from now onwards I'll call you Harfan. You've to start living the cover along with the learning process. Every bit of your personal life should look like that of a Muslim. A keen observer shouldn't be able to detect even a single grain of untruth. Repeat after me: Bismillah-ur-Rehman-e Rahim, In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful; recite with me, La llaha Illa Ilah Mumammad-urRasulu 'llah-There's no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Prophet. Remember this is the Qalema-e-Tayeb, the essence of all praises of the Almighty Allah and his Prophet, Muhammad, son of Abdul Muttalib, of the tribe of Qureysh." ([Location 2067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=2067))
- These are the Holy Books and foundations of Islam. Master the technicalities of the Islamic rituals. These are behestijevars (celestial jewels), like Hindu prescriptions of daily rituals." ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=2073))
- He had taught Harfan all the nuances ofFazr, Zohor, Asar, Maghrib, Isha and Jumma Namaj rituals, with meticulous stress on therituals of Ruqu (bending properly) and Sizda (obeisance in a prostrated position). Standing next to his pupil, Rizwan appreciated the perfect and synchronised performance of. the young devil. Behind his apparent foul and sharp tongue, he had a receptive and razor-sharp mind. Harfan passed the test with flying colours. Even a seasoned namaji would not be able to detect any flaw. "You get just one month to acclimatise in an undiluted Muslim ghetto. Don't forget that you had a phufi (aunt) at Gali Qabristan, behind the dargah (burial place) of Dada Pir Bukhari, ancestor of the Bukhari clan." "The history is fine, but what do I do there?" "Acquaint yourself with the old city. Be a Harfan who grew up in that milieu for the last eighteen years. Learn the finer nuances of living like a Muslim. Live like a true Muslim. In Pakistan, where you're assigned to, you'll be watched by everyone. You have to pass the vital tests when you meet your Uncle Shamim Bukhari. The old man must be nursing many memories under his chest. All migrants do." "I can't get into the roots of a life which aren't mine." "Come on, Harfan," Bhagat cajoled his agent, "you've done it. Now just live like one. That's all. We shall be in touch. Remember my eyes shall all the time follow you. We meet again after a month." ([Location 2084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=2084))
- “There’s a problem,” added Bhagat, “our transborder facilitator Amrik Singh Johal isn’t available at his usual rendezvous. We can’t execute the operation infiltration till he’s located.” ([Location 2129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0087MQ552&location=2129))
