## Highlights
- Some names already end in s, such as Wales, Dickens, Cyrus and Jesus. To show them in their possessive form you need to add a fucking apostrophe after the s. However, there are no set rules as to whether you should add another s after the fucking apostrophe. The general consensus is that you should write it as you’d speak it.

- If you’re referring to an object that belongs to more than one person or thing, then you add the s first to make it plural, then the fucking apostrophe. ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01I0KJC3W&location=148))
- NOTE: People often incorrectly put a fucking apostrophe in decades (70’s Greatest Hits). You should only use fucking apostrophes in dates to show omission (e.g. ’70s = 1970s, although this is increasingly uncommon) or possession (e.g. Keith Chegwin was the 1980s’ greatest sex symbol = Keith Chegwin was the greatest sex symbol from 1980 to 1989. Possibly.). So 70’s Greatest Hits would actually mean the greatest hits of the year 1970. If you want to talk about the whole decade it should be 70s’.
