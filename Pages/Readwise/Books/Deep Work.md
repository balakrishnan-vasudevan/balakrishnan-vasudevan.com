## Highlights
- If you can create something useful, its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, if what you’re producing is mediocre, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online.

- To succeed you have to produce the absolute best stuff you’re capable of producing—a task that requires depth. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=181))
- Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=216))
- Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy 1. The ability to quickly master hard things. 2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=332))
- To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=354))
- If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=360))
- If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value. ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=361))
- If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=368))

- (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=399))
- By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively cementing the skill. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=411))
- To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=419))
- Though Grant’s productivity depends on many factors, there’s one idea in particular that seems central to his method: the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches. Grant performs this batching at multiple levels. Within the year, he stacks his teaching into the fall semester, during which he can turn all of his attention to teaching well and being available to his students. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=439))
- Within a semester dedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his door is open to students and colleagues, and periods where he isolates himself to focus completely and without distraction on a single research task.

- High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00X47ZVXM&location=454))
