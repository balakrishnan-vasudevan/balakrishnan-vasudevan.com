- RICH FOOD: A high tannin red wine acts as a palate cleanser to rich, fatty proteins. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WDHV8Q&location=486))
- SPICY FOOD: A cold sweet wine with low alcohol will counteract the burn of spiciness. ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WDHV8Q&location=488))
- PUNGENT FOOD: Pungent flavors like Gorgonzola match with wines that have higher acidity and sweetness. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WDHV8Q&location=489))
- BITTER FOOD: Bitter foods magnify the bitterness of tannin. Try pairing bitter foods with low or no tannin wines with salinity and sweetness. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B075WDHV8Q&location=491))
