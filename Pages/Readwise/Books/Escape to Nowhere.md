## Highlights
- He main- tained that it would not only make a mockery of the officer’s cover who usually identified himself to the source in a false name and as someone who came from a different professional background but also compromise his new working environ- ment. Moreover, it would render the successor ineffective in handling the source as the latter would have the benefit of run- ning to the raising officer for support, whenever there was a conflict of interest between him and his current operative. It was also the surest recipe for courting disaster of a more serious kind, Jeev explained. With foreign assets being allowed to meet their previous handlers on a regular basis, the field would be left wide open for gullible officers to make indiscriminate contacts and run the inevitable risk of getting both the source and the handler exposed to predators among the foreign intelligence agencies.

- That explained why Zak’s particulars never found their way to the Agency’s dossiers and he remained an unpaid source with no ‘number’. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=105))
- In truth, he never fancied Ravi’s persona and found him fishy, mediocre, and suspiciously withdrawn—qualities that make an officer an ideal pick for talent spotters. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=251))
- The biggest worry, however, was whether the CEU (Counter Espionage Unit) had necessary resources to collect clinching evidences to prosecute Ravi in a court of law. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=257))
- Shetty was placed under surveillance by a joint team of the Agency and the Bureau. He made a clean confession of his crime after he was confronted with the incriminating video footages and subjected to intensive questioning. He was tried in front of a camera, remained in prison for a few years and now leads a reclusive life. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=269))
- Professionally, he was head and shoulders above his colleagues and had the rare gift of talking his way through to the sources, extracting relevant inputs and harnessing those tellingly in his intelligence reports. No wonder successive Bureau Directors could not afford to dispense with his services. A few of them hated his guts but stuck with him for his amazing reach to contacts and sheer brilliance. Then one day, Vijay came to the notice of his own surveillance team for frequently meeting Miss June, a CIA lady officer of the US Embassy in Delhi. His detractors in the Bureau saw in this lapse a god sent opportunity to clip his wings fatally. They attributed unprofessional motives to the photographs showing his proximity to Miss June and made a naive government believe that he was an espionage agent. They also provided deliberate leaks to the media, prompting it to bay for his blood for his alleged involvement in a sex-driven espionage network. However, when it could not be conclusively proved that he peddled Intelligence, Shekhar was forced to seek voluntary retirement. The charge against him was that he did not keep his seniors informed of the nature of gifts that he received from the CIA operative and kept the Bureau in the dark about his indiscrete escapades. A bright career was thus cut short for spurious reasons. Actually, Vijay was too smart to be trapped by a low-witted, unattractive operative. He could talk endlessly and spin yarns of believable inputs without conceding an iota of worthwhile intelligence. He always held important positions both in the Bureau and the Foreign Office and ran some of the most historic secret operations. If he had the temptation of selling intelligence he could have done so in abundance long before Bureau’s surveillance cameras trapped him. If he went overboard, it was typical of his gung-ho style. Like several leaders of outstanding repute, he was uncomfortably liberated in personal life but quintessentially professional. Jeev had also dealt with Miss June for a long time and found her average both in looks and work. Long after she had left India, he thought someday, she might be willing to say whether Vijay was her agent or a part time boyfriend. A year later, an opportunity came when Jeev saw her travelling on the same cruise in Sydney. Her face fell when she saw him and she ran to the upper deck for cover. Before Jeev could catch up with her, she was lost among the tourists on board. After his forced retirement, Vijay continued to be vilified and demeaned. He became the favourite punching bag of his friends and foes alike. His mentors did nothing to redeem his reputation.

- Ravi Mohan was placed under surveillance. The watchers’ brief was to follow him discretely whenever he stepped out of the Agency’s building and keep a visual record of his contact with colleagues and others in the office or en-route. The watch was to be of low intensity and mounted from a safe distance. It was to terminate once the target entered his apartment complex. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=346))
- “I not ruling out anything at this stage. I would, in fact, feel relieved if Ravi was found compromising only principles of restrictive security for enhancing his awareness,” Jeev said. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=455))
- His thoughts raced back to the days when restrictive security was practiced rigidly in the Agency. Only a select few knew what liaison relationship was all about and barely a dozen desk officers were allowed to interact with their counterparts in the foreign intelligence services. Painfully, over the years, the norms governing liaison work were disfigured beyond recognition and as a consequence, the Agency’s operations and reach of its technical and human assets became topics of common gossip. This downslide owed its origin to a weird phenomenon. Since Pakistan, China, and international terrorism figured prominently in discussions with foreign Intelligence services, experts attached to these desks trotted around the globe exchanging information with their counterparts, while their colleagues sulked at Headquarters churning out reports on the peripheral regions. The fact that only a chosen few cornered the foreign trips festered a feeling of deprivation among majority of officers. Added to this was an underlying grudge that they were being deprived of lucrative benefits that were built into foreign tours enabling officers to bring home little extra money, appliances, liquor, and cheese through honest means. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=474))
- On the way back to his room, Jeev peeped inside Vinod Doshi’s room. Doshi was Director in-charge of Insurgency Operations. Finding him closeted in a meeting, he met his gaze, quickly retraced his steps, closed the door and left. While he was waiting for the lift to come up, he saw Doshi hurrying towards him. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=616))
- Taking a break from clearing files, Jeev rang up Prashant Vaish, one of the five Directors of Special Operations, to check if he could come over at 8 pm. Vaish responded positively. Jeev’s next call was to KM who said that he was in the midst of listening to an important intercept. He told Vaish that he would come over as soon as the transcript was ready. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=627))
- “Sir, it may be difficult to tackle Vipul, Desk Officer, Special Operations. He is usually very possessive about information regarding foreign postings and tours. But I will definitely make an effort to get around him,” said Vaish. ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=660))
- In two subsequent pages, Pillai highlighted the conspicuous traits of Ames. In his concluding remarks, he suggested that the CEU must always keep employees of the Agency under their observation to find out whether they suffer from the following behavioural oddities of Ames. He also wanted the CEU to be engaged in prior consultations before assigning officers to sensitive jobs. Dwelling on the flaws in Ames’ persona, he wrote: (a)(Ames and his wife had expensive living habits and lived well beyond their means. For years, CIA took no notice of large expenditures incurred by an employee making annually less than $70,000. (b)Ames entertained his colleagues and friends in a style that was beyond the means of an employee at the level of his seniority. (c)He had willingly let himself be used by Moscow. (d)He exposed the identities of many CIA moles. (e)He was an alcoholic. (f)He used to take details of sensitive CIA moles in Moscow, out of his office on his laptop. (g)Over a dozen middle and senior level officers of the CIA knew all this for years but did not alert the Director, CIA. Jeev smiled as he finished reading Pillai’s mail. “What is it that you are smiling at? I thought official papers made for very drab reading,” Mani remarked as Jeev put the paper inside an envelope and switched off the light. “You know Mr Pillai and his incorrigible sense of dark humour,” Jeev said, trying hard to avoid telling her the real reason. “I know but that cannot be the reason,” Mani reacted, turning over to her side to sleep. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=755))
- In calls to different desk officers, the suspect would ask for copies of the note sent to the government on latest developments in Kashmir, Pakistan-North Korea nuclear nexus, South Block’s latest position on boundary dispute with China, Dalai Lama’s views on the return of Tibetan refugees to Lhasa, CBMs proposed by India to improve relations with Beijing and common areas of cooperation on security issues identified by India, China and Russia. In Ashish, the desk officer for Europe, the suspect found an eager collaborator. In one call, he confided to Ashish that because of his advancing age, he experienced difficulty in remembering details and that’s the reason why he was in the habit of noting down what he discussed with his colleagues and requested for copies of their reports. T54 Seven calls later, the suspect fanned Ashish’s ego, “I hear that you have devised an excellent system of cataloguing the source particulars for quick access and updating the data on a regular basis,” he said and asked if Ashish could show him the format on his desktop. T61 The suspect thanked Ashish for “letting him copy it”. Encouraged by the officer’s unfettered responsiveness, the suspect employed a different ploy to extract information about the Agency’s assets in Europe. “Your format was of great help,” he threw the bait, “but my officers were unable to feed the data. I don’t know if you can bring along the source particulars of one of the European stations and show me how to do it,” he said. “I have no problem, sir. To you, I can make available the source profile of all European stations.” Ashish promised. Spot Report 439 The same day, watchers reported that Ashish went with the suspect for lunch at Hotel Oberoi. U6 The suspect lured an officer from the scientific division to brief him on nuclear developments in Pakistan. “It’s too technical for me to fully comprehend,” he said and requested the officer to send the talking points so that he could properly brief his North Korean source. P14 To a desk officer dealing with Sri Lanka, who initially expressed reluctance to share inputs, the suspect used a mild threat. “The Chief has asked for an inclusive report on LTTE’s terrorist network in South East Asia and suggested that I also incorporate your inputs,” he said. The officer promptly acquiesced. ([Location 875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=875))
- But Jeev was not a learner. Like a man possessed, he opposed attempts by successive governments and their National Security Advisors to create a bizarre organization by mutilating an institution that had proved its worth both in times of wars and peace. He contested this calamitous move as if the government was acquiring his personal property for pittance. In the process, several colleagues of many years became his sworn enemies and the NSAs, his bête noire. In the end, he was a loser on all counts. Jeev’s DNA was actually his undoing. Successive Chiefs wouldn’t let him handle sensitive desks because they considered him ‘indiscreet and a loud mouth’. Actually, they feared that he would quickly dismantle the hype around the desk, ground huffy-puffy operators, and expose the so-called critical assets. An Agency chief who was all sugar and honey refused to assign Jeev to an European station, because he was not sure of the safety of the skeletons of sources in the cupboard. Another chief who made the pretence of treating him as a family member, branded him an “operational disaster” once he realized that Jeev would not allow bogus operations to flourish. No wonder, he came to be viewed as impossible to work with and unyielding. The general refrain was that Jeev was unable to see the larger picture and needlessly got enmeshed in petty issues like honest reporting, observance of rules and financial propriety. Yet he survived the system, because of a few who admired his “idiosyncrasies”. A god-fearing chief would cope with Jeev’s dissenting notes with a condescending smile and disarm the latter completely with his infectious humility. Karthik Pillai whom Jeev admired for his immense courage of conviction, his imperious standard of personal integrity, and his pathological hatred for sycophancy, was a class apart. He had the rare quality of owing up his omissions and keeping his personal and professional matters in watertight compartments. Another officer who made a huge impact on Jeev was a man in dingy clothes, hanging loosely on his bony shoulders. He was gifted with a capacity to innovate the unthinkable and take aggressive operations beyond accepted frontiers. He was daring and but for the constraints under which he worked, he could pluck the moon and let no one know about it. He would be any intelligence agency’s pride but not of his conceited seniors in the Agency. Outside the Agency, Jeev was fascinated by a diminutive, energetic and suave foreign service officer whose intellectual and financial integrity was staggering. He could take quick, out-of-box decisions, once he was convinced of the merits of the case. For him, serving national interest was paramount and he was willing to reach to anyone who served that interest. He was a far cry from hundred others in his own service who were greedy, unreal and vacuous. Now that his retirement was imminent, the time had come to douse the fire in the belly. Why pursue Ravi’s case when evidences were… ([Location 1154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1154))
- His controlling officer was so mortally afraid of taking failures in his stride that he would instantly get into fits if Vivek talked of “instant action”. His Division Head, who seemed to have prematurely attained enlightenment, sniffed blood in every operational proposal that Vivek put up. The Chief hardly helped the matter. He advised Vivek to curb his hyperactive impulses and repeatedly turned down his plea for funds to undertake missions that would have mauled the enemy.

- “Sir, there is no reason why the suspect would go to Patiala only two hours before the departure of the two ladies when he could have met them in Delhi at the place and time of his choice by observing simple counter surveillance measures,” KM argued. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1367))
- Jeev kept agonizing over the presence of Merylene and Jasmeet. The first thing that he did after reaching the office was to call Keshav Nath, a Joint Secretary in the MEA, for a background check on the two women staffers of the US Embassy. Nath who had earlier served under Jeev and built an enduring working relationship, promised to get back to him soon. What always impressed Jeev was Nath’s uncanny ability to effectively hide secrets behind the veil of his innocent laughter. The next officer whom he called was Prashant Vaish. He wanted to know whether he could obtain details about Ravi’s leave and his assignments. Vaish said that he was on his way to submit the report. ([Location 1371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1371))
- Similarly, when I approached Desk Officer, Africa and Europe, they allowed me to scan the data on sources without asking any questions,” Vaish mentioned. ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1378))
- “Sir, he was always eager to talk to officers from other operational and analysis branches. ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1389))
- The suspect joined the Agency on deputation in 1986 and remained posted at Headquarters till 1994. Thereafter, he was posted to Nairobi on an assignment for three years. The Kenyan climate did not suit him and he fell sick. He was initially treated by local doctors but despite prolonged medication, his recovery was very slow. Then he took leave and went to John Hopkins, Baltimore, USA, for a check-up where his parents lived. After serving for six months in Nairobi, he proceeded on leave again, this time to Vienna. There, he underwent a bypass at the AKH hospital. The suspect returned to Delhi in 1998 where he worked in different capacities for five years. During this period, he visited his mother in the US twice on leave, once in 1998 and the second time in ‘99. His next foreign assignment was in Brussels from 2001 to 2004. During this period, he took vacations rather frequently and visited Paris, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva, and, of course, Baltimore on three occasions. Four weeks before he left Brussels on transfer to Delhi in January 2005, he intimated Headquarters that he had bought a Toshiba laptop for 1200 US dollars but did not furnish a receipt. In 2006 and 2007 he visited Baltimore, each time for three weeks. In 2007, he went to Washington on 21 days’ training to learn interrogation techniques. Two weeks after his Washington tour, he visited Kathmandu on a week’s leave with his wife. He had also been deputed to MI6 for three days’ training in analysing reports in 2005 and to National Intelligence Agency in Bangkok for two days in November 2007 for consultations. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1393))
- The suspect raised seven new contacts at Nairobi. Of these, five were of Indian origin, one was a US Press Attaché Durante and the other one was a lady named Angelien from the Netherland Embassy. Records show that these two were not paid sources but semi-conscious agents who were dropped by Ravi from the roll before he moved to Delhi. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1406))
- In the margin, Naik, then Chief Analyst of Europe division, wrote that the Vienna officer should rather concentrate on raising sources rather than sniffing around his seniors’ armpits’. ([Location 1413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1413))
- He finally managed to speak to the China Desk Officer and requested him to brief him on what to ask from a visiting source, an expert in the field of nuclear proliferation in South Asia. ([Location 1479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1479))

- “I suggest you call Somayya, head of the Science Division. He is an expert on the subject and can assist you in resolving technical issues,” the Desk officer hung up. ([Location 1487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1487))
- After he put it back in the envelope, he opened the security latch and rang up Director Pak military operations, Ajeet Bhaduri. ([Location 1518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1518))
- “It is supposed to review the security situation in J&K and resolve the problems of coordination, bedevilling the security forces and the intelligence agencies, but what you witness is a dogfight,” he claimed. ([Location 1526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1526))
- He was Venkatpathy, Desk Officer, Cyber operations. As Venkat took his seat, Ravi further increased the volume of the TV which greatly affected the clarity of their conversation. Amid the humming and screeching noises, Ravi was heard asking questions about hacking. In response, Venkat launched into a discourse on how hacking helped in tracking terrorist network and breaking their codes. It seemed that Ravi did not comprehend what the visitor was trying to explain. After his twenty-minute monologue, Venkat left. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1546))
- He said he was reading comments offered by concerned divisions on a document circulated by the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), detailing gaps in Intelligence that were allegedly left uncovered by the Agency during last year. NSCS, he disclosed, had graded the overall performance of the Agency as below par. ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1640))
- He said that Sachdeva, Deputy National Security Advisor (NSA) began by enumerating the targets allotted to each of the outfits and then highlighted the shortfalls in their inputs. He singled out the Agency for faring the worst. This was followed by a free-for-all bashing of the Agency’s performance by the three Chiefs of the Defence Forces, Director of the Bureau, and the NSA himself. Wasan claimed that he tried to hold the ground as best as he could and finally managed to buy some time so that he could come back with a detailed, factual response. ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1648))
- “The indictment was typically clerical,” Wasan said. “They quoted statistics to claim that we failed miserably in providing precise and timely tactical and strategic intelligence on the build-up and deployment of Chinese and Pak defence forces, developing political changes in our neighbourhood, support to terrorists and insurgents from the establishment in Pakistan and Bangladesh and the current status of nuclear and missile stockpile in the region,” he added. “Did the NSA not defend you against his deputy’s supercilious assessment?” Jeev asked. ([Location 1653](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1653))
- “But it is also a sin to take calumny from sinners,” Jeev countered. “What does the Bureau say about the Naxalites’ relentless march in state after state, insurgents’ perennial violence in the north east, mushrooming of indigenous terrorist modules, and the emergence of a powerful parallel Islamic culture riding piggy back on India’s secularism? How does the huge Army explain its sleepwalk when Pak armed intruders dig trenches and build defences in Kargil or when armed militants infiltrate daily and keep J&K hostage. What does the Air Force say when Peter Bleach’s Latvian AN-26 flies across three-fourths of the country’s airspace to drop arms in Purulia or when its fighters disintegrate in air every day at such colossal cost to the national Exchequer? How does the Navy explain its deep slumber when a few suicide bombers sail across the Arabian Sea to the Gateway of India to strike the Taj and Oberoi hotels with guns and detonators? And, how does NSCS account for its existence when not one percent of its reports contribute to influencing political leadership to take major policy decisions on economic, diplomatic, and security issues? Why doesn’t the NSCS also issue a report card on its annual performance and that of MEA and economic ministries? They must understand that sporadic failures cannot be cited to deride achievements. It’s ironic that the Agency is supposed to be the Prime Minister’s exclusive responsibility but everyone else questions its worth except the Prime Minister. A diatribe from you on these lines would have sent your predators scurrying for cover.” ([Location 1672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1672))
- The Defence Intelligence Agency is working overtime to have their officers in almost all major countries to collect military intelligence. I am fighting hard to arrest the shrinking space for our operatives. And now this crazy proposal of the NSCS to take away my vital tools for collecting technical intelligence to create an outfit, to provide employment to the unemployables,” Wasan expressed in disgust. ([Location 1690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1690))
- He informed that a Dinesh Mehra was on the line and insisted that he had been asked by Mr Vinod Doshi to speak directly to Mr Jeevnathan. ([Location 1731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1731))
- “No, sir, except that the suspect takes different routes to get back to his house. I have noticed this pattern of his movement ever since the anonymous caller warned him of being tailed,” KM said. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1742))

- Desk Officer, China Military, said he was representing the Agency in a meeting of a visiting PLA delegation from China, hosted by Ministry of Defence. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1889))
- Lokesh Kumar, Desk Officer Nepal, talked about Maoist violence and the Royal Nepalese Army’s inability to contain armed Maoist volunteers. ([Location 1891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1891))
- Ashish, Desk Officer Europe, keept his earlier promise and helped Miss Sethi to fill in the particulars of a source in the format devised by him and admired by the suspect. He also brought along the profiles of a few Agency officers posted in Europe and left that on Ravi’s table. Later on, they go out for lunch. Ravi returned alone, copied the document and put the original paper in an envelope and went to Ashish’s room to personally hand it over saying that he did not want to retain it in view of its sensitivity. ([Location 1894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1894))
- Mahesh Soni, China analyst, talks about his achievements in raising numerous contacts in South East Asia and CIS countries. He bemoaned that his achievements have not been fully recognized by the policemen at the top. Ravi chooses not to respond. ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1898))
- The Desk Officer Sri Lanka appears deeply reverential to Ravi. ([Location 1903](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1903))
- “You can’t raid his house without a court warrant. And for that, you need to register a police case. You also don’t have the license to physically torture him and make him confess what you want to hear. At best you can question him. His answer would probably be that he photocopied papers and took them home to keep abreast of latest developments. He would explain that he did not permit anyone to handle his brown bag because it contained secret papers and shredded these once he finished assimilating the information,” Jeev said. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=1965))
- Jeev then rang up Purnendu Basu, head of the Photo Division, and asked him to come over in case he was free. ([Location 2234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2234))
- In another incident, a head of state, who was already air- borne sought permission to land his special aircraft at one of the secret airstrips under the operational jurisdiction of Jeev. He promptly refused. Soon calls poured in from the Chief, Principal Secretary and Cabinet Secretary and the state Chief Secretary. They even threatened to take the matter to the Prime Minister but Jeev refused to budge. “Sir, the pilot has just informed that he is about to land and it is too late for him to divert the aircraft to any other runways,” Jeev’s Operations Manager was the last to call him. “Block the runway,” Jeev instructed. He received no request or threats from any one thereafter. The aircraft landed in the civilian area. Mani thought her husband’s handling of the situation was foolhardy. The Chief, however, called to thank him for not bending backwards and saving him from a huge embarrassment. ([Location 2341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2341))
- Finally at 4.30 pm, Anuj Nagia, the Desk Officer of Africa Division, visited Ravi at his insistence for fresh lime water. ([Location 2380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2380))
- Among his visitors was the Desk Officer Europe, who informed that several new stations were likely to be opened in the CIS countries and he was tipped to man one of them. ([Location 2496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2496))
- He revealed that ‘Mushroom’, Agency’s most important source on nuclear proliferation was missing from North Korea. Ajeet was the last to drop in. He disclosed that his tour to Kabul had been approved by the Chief. He also mentioned that he had been sounded to get ready to go on a foreign posting some time later during the year. He hinted that he could join at Prague and not Jordan. ([Location 2497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2497))
- You know how successfully I created assets inside the Pakistan Rangers and foiled several of their bids to push across terrorists when I was posted in the north-west Bureau,” Ravi said. ([Location 2530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2530))
- Commodore Pradeep Nair, Director Naval Operations, dropped in to apprise him of the Navy’s intelligence requirements for the next year. The Desk Officer Europe informed him about the Chief’s proposed visit to Mauritius. The Desk Officer Nepal gave an overview on the strength of the Nepalese Army and the Marxist cadre. Desk Officer Sri Lanka briefed him on the latest political developments in the island nation. ([Location 2537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2537))
- After these officers were gone, Ravi rang Shastri, in-charge of high grade operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but the later politely declined to come over, saying that he was preoccupied with a visiting Egyptian delegation. ([Location 2659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=2659))
- “In the case of Shetty and Vijay Shekhar, we caught the handler on tape. In this case, there is no trace of the handler in our visuals. As I told you earlier, you can dismiss him under Article 311(2)(c) anytime now. But if you want to file a case against him for espionage, you may have to depend entirely on the unverifiable version of his confession,” Jeev contended. Wasan did not appear to be convinced. “Then, let us involve the Bureau to reinforce our surveillance. That could help in locating the handler early,” he said.

- “Princi (a pet name that Agency chiefs often used to address the Principal Secretary in informal discussions to honour his status in the PM’s court), is Minister in-charge of the Agency. He is entitled to know about a case that vitally affects our security. It also makes practical sense that we keep him in the loop,” the Chief averred.

- Kailash Uike, the Head of the Eastern Bureau, was expected to come in any moment. He had called Ravi very early in the morning to say that he had something important to clarify. “How did you know that I was being tailed and the Chief would not sanction my leave?” Ravi asked even before Uike took his seat.

- “The old practice was not without positives,” Jeev pointed out. “Initially you picked up relatives from known and tested families, who naturally remained loyal, contended, and discreet. It is only when you started accepting drop-outs and acquaint- ances on the basis of recommendations that you landed with those who looted your coffers, weakened your operational base and betrayed your trust. An instant case is that of Ravi. But the direct recruits are not a bad crop and have a distinct advantage. They can slide into the cover role of diplomats more smoothly than their counterparts from the Police and security forces because of their demeanour, their raw intellect, and youthfulness,” he said. “But it is the uniformed officers who contribute to the bulk of our substantive output,” KM argued. “There is no denying that they usually bring to the Agency their network of contacts, their investigative skills and their courage to take decision in adverse circumstances. But quite a few of them are also very selfish, dishonest, self-opinionated, and vindictive,” Jeev said. “Sir, maybe we should then involve the Bureau. They won’t take long to fix the suspect by planting incriminating objects and book him for committing treason,” KM suggested.

- “It’s both very demanding and exciting,” Venkat sounded eager to share his work. He then went on to talk about the websites that he claimed to have cracked, tele-communication tools which the Agency planned to exploit for psychological warfare and a proposal for setting up a Code Interpretation Unit at a secret location in the NCR. He also referred to a likely meeting in Dubai of the Deputy Chief with a Non-Resident Pakistani for setting up a financial hub to find out groups and institutions that were channelizing funds to terrorists operating from Pakistan. Then he reeled off names and location of some of those outfits and spilled out the fictitious nom-de-plumes of the Agency’s operators who were going to be involved in this operation. Ravi thanked Venkat and enquired he could give some lessons on tracking the websites of extremist Islamic outfits operating in Far East Asian countries. Venkat said that he would do that sometime during the next week. ([Location 3061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=3061))
- After Venkat left, Ravi rang up Naresh Shukla, the Desk Officer for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Shukla said that he had just returned from a meeting, convened to discuss phased withdrawal of the US troops from Kabul and its likely impact on our security situation.

- As soon as Vyas paused for the drink, Ravi asked if he had any idea of how the Bureau’s counter espionage unit functioned. “I don’t have any specific knowledge but I guess it is quite effective. It has a huge network of field staff and their success rate in cracking espionage cases is very impressive. Our Counter Espionage Unit, with its paltry resources and half a dozen ill- trained and ill-equipped watchers, is no patch on them. But why are you asking this?” Vyas inquired. “A friend of mine who is of the rank of a Major General in the Armed Forces, suspects that he is being followed by the Bureau’s watchers,” Ravi instantly cooked up an alibi. “Since you served in the Bureau for more than a decade, I thought you would know better whether the Bureau accepted such commitments from other departments or mounted surveillance suo moto on the basis of their field reports,” he said. Vyas did not immediately respond. “Does the Bureau also keep a watch on our officers?” he fished for an answer. “Yes. This probably is the one area in which the Agency and the Bureau work very closely together,” Vyas claimed. Ravi’s face instantly fell and he started looking distraught. He waited for the visitor to finish drinking his fresh lime water and leave. ([Location 3145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=3145))

- Even the genial, pleasant, and usually unflappable Neelesh Burman, who headed the Pakistan/ Afghanistan Division, cracked when Laxman, a junior CEU employee, demanded that he open his briefcase. In a moment of blinding rage, Burman abused Laxman and before the latter could react, he exited in a hurry with his briefcase, sat down in the car and sped off in a hurry. Kamath, who was watching the fracas from a distance, rushed to block the car. ([Location 3327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=3327))

- “How did you get to know that Shetty was peddling classified information?” asked Ravi. “Sir, the Kashmir Desk reported that some of their crucial operational inputs on J&K operations were being passed on to the ISI. The suspicion gained currency following decisive assaults by Pak-trained militants against some of our sensitive security targets. What rang the alarm bell was the exposure of a few of our POK-based sources, operated by Shetty. Subse- quently, he was placed under intensive surveillance by the Bureau and his movements were video recorded and analysed meticulously. Later on, he was called to Headquarters and detained. Confronted with the video footage of his escapades, he broke down and wrote a long note in which he confessed about his wrongdoings,” Moily said. “So it was a joint operation.” “Yes, sir, but those were different times. The Agency Chief and Director of the Bureau worked in tandem and officers on both sides of the Great Divide could bury their mutual jealousy and years of grievances when it came to serving national security interests,” Moily explained. “Do you notice any similarity in your handling of investiga- tion in Shetty’s case and the way the CEU is conducting its investigation now?” Ravi asked, trying to ascertain the exact purpose and target of the search. “It is difficult to say because one doesn’t know who Mr Kamath is after and, why. While investigating Shetty, we had a definite idea of the target and the handler and, therefore, we never felt the need for organizing a mass search. Actually, it doesn’t make sense that instead of nailing the suspected officer and his handler outside the building, the CEU should waste its time checking papers from officers’ briefcases when it is public knowledge that most officers carry classified documents to their homes routinely. Frankly, I don’t know what Mr Kamath is trying to achieve. Maybe, he is faced with a far more serious and complicated situation,” Moily indicated. “Did you ever physically torture Shetty to extract a confession? Do you think the CEU would use third-degree methods like the police against its own officers?” Ravi prodded. “I don’t know what the CEU does now. We subjected Shetty only to intense questioning and repeatedly brought out contradictions in his statements. We selectively used the video images of his activities to nail his lies and when he knew that his game was up, he wrote his confession. What really clinched the case was the footage in which he was seen meeting and passing on documents to the handler,” Moily disclosed.

- Kamath thought the suspect’s fondness for the Gita was quite comical. Here was a man whose entire life and work was an antithesis of the Scripture’s core philosophy, defined in terms of vigorous pursuance of truth. The suspect was never known to be a reader of serious books and enjoyed a reputation of going through files and notes casually. But where it mattered, he appeared to be working hard, meticulously sifting value-added inputs and spending hours briefing and debriefing his colleagues without fear or remorse. Maybe in the Gita, KM assumed, the suspect found an escape from his guilt. Convicts usually turned to praying and reading holy scriptures, deriving solace from words of wisdom within the bland, grey and lifeless walls of prison. The suspect was no exception.

- A few minutes later, Nidhi Singh, Director in-charge of International Terrorism, called the suspect and requested if he could spare his car for half an hour. She said that she had to deliver a note urgently on operational linkage of Kashmiri militants with radical Islamic outfits in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Iran to the National Security Advisor but there was no staff car readily available. Ravi explained that he had no problem but she must return positively by 6.30 pm. Then he rang up Moily to confirm whether his bag had also been searched by the CEU officers.

- “Sir, my hats off to the ISI,” KM said. “It has penetrated almost every institution in the country and is giving us a run for our lives everywhere. In response what we do is squirm and shy away from inflicting collateral damages. The ISI must be marvelling at our skill of issuing empty threats and enjoying their luck for dealing with an enemy that has a spine made of rhetoric,” he remarked.

- “I don’t see it happening anytime in the future,” Jeev said. “Every prime minister desperately wants to carve a niche for himself in history books by improving relations with Pakistan. But he ends up debilitating the Agency’s operating infrastructure, built over a long period with enormous sweat and resources, by asking it to suspend its forward operations. What they do not understand is that intelligence operations and diplomacy can run parallel and one need not be sacrificed for the other to succeed.” By now, Jeev had reached the porch.

- Gilbert, a tall, moustached, burly looking US national is the CIA Station Chief at Kathmandu. His name figures in the US Embassy’s list of diplomats as Counsellor (Economic Affairs). On Day 92, Gilbert flew to Bhairahwa by YT 161 and checked into Hotel Yeti. He received Ravi and his party in the evening and took them to Room nos. 205 and 206. He himself was staying in Room no. 211. All three rooms were booked on Day 91 in the name of Gilbert by Abheek Pokharel of Himalaya Travels located in Kathmandu. On the same day, air tickets were purchased care of US embassy vide bill no.1953 that included Gilbert’s one-way ticket to Bhairahwa and three tickets for return journey for Gilbert and Mr and Mrs Ravi Mohan.

- The Chief summoned Douglas Walters, the CIA station Head in Delhi, to the office and conveyed his anguish over the role played by Gilbert in Ravi’s defection to the US. He also demanded to be briefed about whether the decision to subvert Ravi had been authorized by the Director CIA or planned and executed by a rogue operative as part of his general brief to recruit officers of the Intelligence Services in the region. Walters routinely pleaded ignorance. He claimed that he was not even aware of the presence of any CIA officer the name Gilbert at the US Embassy in Kathmandu. However, he promised to get back after checking with his officers at the Headquarters in Langley. ([Location 5500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B008NXNCQU&location=5500))
- Meanwhile, Principal Secretary Saran manipulated the government to draft the services of Krishnan, a former Bureau veteran and a congenital baiter of the Agency, to inquire into the circumstances of Ravi’s escape and recommend measures to prevent recurrence of similar security lapses in future. For Krishnan, it was an opportunity of a life time to run down the Agency. He grabbed the offer with both hands. With the zeal of a possessed man, he interrogated the Chief for hours, burning gallons of midnight oil but miserably failed to pull the dead rat out of the chestnut of evidences. Essentially trained as an analyst, Krishnan was unable to comprehend the enormity and complexity of this operation. In the end, he produced a report, replete with impressions and claims, acquired in the comforts of hindsight. He debunked the investigation as ill-conceived and unprofessionally executed and placed the blame for Ravi Mohan’s escape on in-fighting among officers, existence of parallel centres of power, and collapse of restrictive security at all levels. Ever a prisoner of words, he used the expression, “systemic failure” to sum up his warped opinion of what led to the escape.

- As a result, tribal loyalties emerged, with each group and service standing firm with its own tribe. They saw colleagues not as partners in trade but as enemies, promoting bitter turf wars, factional fight and motivated propaganda. There was no longer a collective pride in standing by the achievements and failures of fellow colleagues in the Agency. Their passionate tribal commitment did not allow them to look beyond their own tribe and learn lessons from other organizations that refused to wash their dirty linen in public and instead, addressed their frustrations and grievances within their own system. Attempts at subduing the Agency’s tribalism remained ineffective, paving way for the media to have abundance of inputs from inside sources.

- Ironically, Ravi Mohan left behind misfortune for his operatives and reprieve for his collaborators. Gilbert, the CIA station head at Kathmandu, was recalled from Nepal and retired compulsorily for badly handling Ravi’s escape and exposing the CIA’s involvement. He was charged for travelling to and fro in his original name on Kathmandu-Bhairahwa sector which figured in the passenger manifest, bought tickets in serial of 475286, 87 and 88 for himself, Ravi and his wife, authorised Himalaya Travels to bill him in his real name and designation, which had details of his one way ticket from Kathmandu to Bhairahwa and three tickets for return journey. Gilbert was also accused of indiscretion for introducing himself in his actual name to Baljeet and later on, signing in his real name on the receipts for payments at Hotel Yeti for the rooms and food. He was also indicted for taking no measures to destroy the records of the passports, issued by the “Authority”, Washington DC and details of tickets in the office of the Nepalese Immigration.

- Timothy Glenn, Director, Operations for South East Asia at Langley, was reprimanded for failing to ensure that the Agent was evacuated covertly, without leaving any tell-tale marks behind. He was pulled up for using Angelien as an escort when she had long ceased to be involved in running the Agent and for putting the CIA in a fix for a source, whose performance throughout was low on benefits and very high on the cost. Glenn left the CIA within weeks of receiving his indictment. He now teaches at Stanford. Angelien was returned to the Homeland Security and is now posted at Chicago.

Whenever he suffers from bouts of intense hatred for hypocrisy that pervades politics, bureaucracy and individual relationships, he goes out and talks to poor villagers in the neighbourhood. For a couple of years, he tried to float an NGO to help them become financially self-reliant but couldn’t go far because he wouldn’t pay “commission” to officials and politicians or fudge reports to obtain funds. Since he loathed publicity and sycophancy and insisted on propriety, donors of every denomination shunned him.
