## Highlights
- Now I think it’s one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child—What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end. ([Location 59](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079ZYWJJ8&location=59))
- Your story is what you have, what you will always have. It is something to own. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079ZYWJJ8&location=81))
- Time, as far as my father was concerned, was a gift you gave to other people. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B079ZYWJJ8&location=621))
