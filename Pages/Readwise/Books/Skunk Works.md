## Highlights
- You don’t need Harvard to teach you that it’s more important to listen than to talk. You can get straight A’s from all your Harvard profs, but you’ll never make the grade unless you are decisive: even a timely wrong decision is better than no decision. The final thing you’ll need to know is don’t half-heartedly wound problems—kill them dead. That’s all there is to it. Now you can run this goddam place. Now, go on home and pour yourself a drink.” ([Location 3972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A2DIW3C&location=3972))
- “Ben, if I teach you anything, it’s this: don’t build an airplane you don’t believe in. Don’t prostitute yourself for bucks.” ([Location 4108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A2DIW3C&location=4108))
