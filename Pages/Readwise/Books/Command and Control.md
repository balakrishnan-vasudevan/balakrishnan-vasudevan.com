## Highlights
- Pyongyang, North Korea Ian Thomas despised North Korea. In his thirty-eight years, he had lived in some dark places, but the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was hands down his least favorite country on Earth. A cult of personality masquerading as a nation-state—with nuclear weapons. If the Minister were here, he would most assuredly endow Ian with some bit of ancient wisdom that boiled down to the simple fact that he wasn’t in Pyongyang to pass judgment on their quality of governance. He was there to deliver a pointed message to the leader of this godforsaken country and get back to Vladivostok before his cover was blown. Ian hadn’t seen his mentor in person in years and wondered how the old man was doing. In fact, if he tried to picture the man’s face now, the details washed away in his memory. It had been that long. But that was the life of a deep cover agent. He was an instrument of the State, the tip of the spear, the knife-edge of a scalpel, so sharp that the victim often failed to sense the first cut. Enough daydreaming. He drew his fingers away from the missing chunk of flesh on his right earlobe, the reminder of a fight from his very first mission as an operative for the Minister. The first of many injuries in his work for the Minister, but certainly the most visible. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B099CPZDPW&location=85))
