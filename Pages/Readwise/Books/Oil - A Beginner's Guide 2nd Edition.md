## Highlights
- New fuels were superior to coal in every respect: they had higher heat content (releasing more energy per unit mass when burned), were easier and safer to produce, cleaner and more convenient to burn and offered an incomparable flexibility of final uses.

- Fuel injected into the cylinder of diesel engines is ignited spontaneously by high temperatures generated by compressing the fuel twice as much as it is compressed in Otto’s engines. Diesel engines work at a higher pressure and lower speed, and large stationary machines have best efficiencies just above 50% and automotive engines can approach 40%. Gasoline engines used to be 20–30% less efficient but their best new designs have almost closed the gap. Diesel fuel has other advantages: it contains about 11% more energy than gasoline in the same volume, it is slightly cheaper than gasoline and it is not dangerously flammable. Low flammability makes diesel engines particularly suitable in any setting where a fire could be an instant disaster (such as on board ships) as well as in the tropics where high temperatures will cause little evaporation from vehicle and ship tanks. And the combination of high engine efficiency, higher volumetric energy density and low fuel volatility means that diesel-powered vehicles can go farther without refueling than equally sized gasoline engines. Additional mechanical advantages include the diesel engine’s high torque, its resistance to stalling when the speed drops, and its inherent ruggedness.

- In jet engines the compression of air precedes the addition of fuel in a combustor, the combustion goes on continuously rather than intermittently, and the energy of the hot air flow is extracted by a turbine that is connected to the compressor by a shaft. Gas turbines first compress the air (up to 40 times above the atmospheric level) before forcing it through the combustion chamber where its temperature more than doubles. Part of the energy of the hot gas rotates the turbine and the rest generates forward thrust by exiting through the exhaust nozzle.

- By changing the gas compression and adding extra fans ahead of the compressor, two streams of exhaust gas are created – high-speed core exhaust which is enveloped by a volume of slower by-pass air; this reduces noise and produces a higher thrust. In the latest engine designs more than 90% of air compressed by an engine bypasses its combustion chamber, reducing both fuel consumption and engine noise. While turbojets reach their peak thrust at the very high speeds needed for fighter planes, turbofans do so at low speeds, a great advantage in making heavy planes airborne.

- kerosene is 47% of the take-off weight of the Boeing 777–200LR, currently the passenger aeroplane with the longest-range; on a trans-oceanic flight nearly 45% (about 175t) of a Boeing 747 is kerosene and at cruising altitude (typically 10–12km above sea level) the aircraft’s four engines consume about 3.2kg (roughly 4l) of the fuel every second.

- In 1900 American farmers needed an average of about three minutes’ labor to produce 1kg of wheat, but by the year 2000 the time was down to just two seconds and the best producers now do it in one second. The price of this progress is that, as Howard Odum aptly put it, we are now eating potatoes partially made of oil.
