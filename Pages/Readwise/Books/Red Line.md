## Highlights
- On the Turkish coast southeast of the city of Adana stood a large villa that functioned for years as a portal into one of the biggest and most secretive CIA operations of recent times. The house was well-appointed, with numerous bedrooms, a swimming pool, and a spacious table near the front entrance where the Americans held meetings with an endless parade of bearded visitors in grubby combat fatigues. The CIA’s men would sit around the table to unfurl their maps, discuss tactics, and, when the talking was done, dispense envelopes filled with cash. The money was mostly salaries for ordinary fighters, ones who gained acceptance into the CIA’s program but never saw the villa where their leaders went to receive guidance and draw their unit’s share of guns and grenades. These ordinary men crossed the border farther south, near the Turkish town of Reyhanli, and after a quick pat-down and questioning, filed into buses for training camps as far away as Ankara, the capital city some four hundred miles to the north. As many as three hundred Syrians made the trek each week, eventually taking their places in classrooms or at firing ranges where CIA paramilitary trainers demonstrated how to read a topo map, blow a bridge, or use a night-vision scope. By the spring of 2015, thousands of rebels had completed the training and disappeared again across the border, often never to be seen again. Over time the CIA’s Turkish operation acquired a nickname: MOM, from a Turkish acronym used by the host country’s intelligence service. But the official code name was Timber Sycamore. Other than the physical destruction of Syria’s chemical stockpile, it was the most significant action taken by the United States in response to Bashar al-Assad’s poison-gas attacks. That spring, after months of struggles, it seemed to be working. Aided by a highly secretive American arms program, the rebels suddenly were winning. Syrian soldiers were dying, and government-controlled towns falling, in numbers not seen since the start of the war. Yet those gains were making some in Washington very nervous. The rebel surge was real enough, but it was not exactly as it seemed. ([Location 4254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083RZTNBF&location=4254))
- Within the White House, occasional arguments erupted over the meaning of the buildup. U.S. surveillance networks over the summer picked up an additional clue: the Russians were beginning to use a sensitive communications system that normally was reserved for use during military engagements. “They’re going into combat in Syria,” one official told a meeting of Obama’s National Security Council. The finding was debated but ultimately discounted. Yes, Russia appeared to be building a full-fledged military base at Khmeimim, but if Moscow was truly preparing to go on the attack, surely there would be evidence of a more tangible sort: Russian Su-27 fighter planes parked on the runway. Yet it was happening. Russia perceived its Syrian investments—its Arab ally, its navy base and warm-water port, its surveillance network and listening posts— as being gravely at risk. And it was ready to defend them. ([Location 4392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083RZTNBF&location=4392))
