## Highlights
- “He thinks, he acts, ’tis done.” ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=192))
- “Men are what their mothers made them.” ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=523))
- Two of the most important—and rarely acknowledged—points about the Apollo lunar landing program are that it was engineering—much more than science—that accomplished the Moon landing, and that an engineer, not a scientist, was the first to set foot on another world. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=1313))
- “luck, opportunity, preparation, and skill converged,” ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=1551))
- “quiet without being shy. He was confident without bragging. He listened intently.” ([Location 1627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=1627))
- It is evidently necessary, therefore, that engineers—men with scientific training and trained to observe accurately, to criticize fairly, to think logically—should become pilots, in order that the development of aeroplanes may proceed at the rate at which it must proceed if we are to hold that place in the air to which we lay claim—the highest. ([Location 2206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=2206))
- it was much easier to make a pilot out of an engineer than it was to make an engineer out of a pilot. ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=2285))
- “The other guys who flew seat of the pants knew instinctively what to do, but they didn’t always know why. Neil knew why.” ([Location 2641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=2641))
- A good father naturally loves all his children. Yet there is often something special between a father and a daughter, perhaps especially with Neil, whose formative relationships were with his mother and his sister rather than his father and his brother. ([Location 3019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=3019))
- “My first impression of Neil was that he was quiet,” stated Frank Borman. “Because he was so quiet and so thoughtful, when he said something, it was worth listening to. ([Location 4262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=4262))
- “Neil was certainly reserved, deep, and thoughtful. He would not utter things that would have much potential of being challenged later because of their spontaneity. I think you learned that in the test pilot business.” ([Location 4270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=4270))
- “He would take a long time coming to a solution, but when it was made, that was that.” ([Location 4274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=4274))
- “Neil was at his peak when he was operating at his peak. He was never in a frantic mode, but he was quick. . . . I was very comfortable with him, not that I could predict everything that he was going to say or decide. I think you had to work with him to understand him. He was very easy to work with. He was a very smart guy. He could make an analysis of a problem very quickly. ([Location 4300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=4300))
- Neil looked up and I said, ‘I just heard the funniest story!’ He said, ‘What?’ I said, ‘I heard that you bailed out of the LLTV an hour ago.’ He thought a second and said, ‘Yeah, I did.’ I said, ‘What happened?’ He said, ‘I lost control and had to bail out of the darn thing.’ ” Bean continues his story: “So, I went back down and told the other guys. Nobody gave a thought to rush down there and ask Neil about it. If it had been Pete Conrad, everybody would have rushed down there, because Pete would have regaled them with a great story. I don’t think it was that Neil was so extraordinarily cooler than the other guys. But, offhand, I can’t think of another person, let alone another astronaut, who would have just gone back to his office after ejecting a fraction of a second before getting killed. He never got up at an all-pilots meeting and told us anything about it. That was an incident that colored my opinion about Neil ever since. He was so different than other people.” Neil’s reaction to hearing Al Bean’s story is just as circumspect as his behavior in the story itself: “That is true, I did go back to the office. I mean, what are you going to do? It’s one of those sad days when you lose a machine.” ([Location 6396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=6396))
- “To see the Earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the Earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold—brothers who know they are truly brothers.” ([Location 6553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=6553))
- “He loved to eat and he understood French food and introduced me to a lot of things that I wouldn’t have tried by myself. Some of the Americans were joining wine study clubs, but Mike didn’t have to. He had learned a lot about wines from his father, and he had studied up on vineyards so he could tell wonderful stories about them. In fact he could talk about everything. He knew books; he knew poetry; he was interested in theater. He was bright about technical things, and he was lots and lots of fun. I couldn’t get over all this combination in one man.” ([Location 6668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=6668))
- “It was, and still is, that everything will be okay; that everything will work out.” ([Location 6673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=6673))
- “I’m not always convinced that everything is going to work out well. On the other hand, there’s nothing wrong in acting as if things will work out. I mean, if I tell my wife I believe in the Easter Bunny—well, why not? Either he exists or he doesn’t, and I choose to believe. But if you really cornered me, I’d have to admit reluctantly that there is no Easter Bunny. Maybe.” ([Location 6702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=6702))
- “a curious mixture of magnificent confidence bordering on conceit, and humility.” ([Location 6811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=6811))
- “Neil was Neil. Calm, quiet, and absolute confidence. We all knew that he was the Lindbergh type. He had no ego. He was not of a mind that, ‘Hey, I’m going to be the first man on the Moon!’ That was never what Neil had in his head. The most Neil had ever said about it might have been that he wanted to be the first test pilot on the Moon or the first flier to land on the Moon. If you would have said to him, ‘You are going to be the most famous human being on Earth for the rest of your life,’ he would have answered. ‘Then I don’t want to be the first man on the Moon.’ But he probably knew it was his obligation to do so. On the other hand, Aldrin desperately wanted the honor and wasn’t quiet in letting it be known. Neil had said nothing. It wasn’t his nature to push himself into any spotlight. He was much like Bob Gilruth himself, content to do the job and then go home. ([Location 7157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=7157))
- “Buzz Aldrin was the crewman usually involved in discussing mission rules, demonstrating his knowledge of a variety of subjects, and generally dominating the crew side of the conversations. Neil Armstrong seemed more the observer than the participant, but when you looked at his eyes, you knew he was the commander and had all the pieces assembled in his mind. I don’t think he ever raised his voice. He just saved his energy for when it was needed. He would listen to our discussions, and if there was any controversy, he and Aldrin would try out our ideas in the simulators and then give feedback through Charlie Duke to the controllers. ([Location 7422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=7422))
- That evening at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington an anonymous someone placed a small bouquet of flowers on the grave of John F. Kennedy, without whom (even though his reasons for doing so were mostly political) there would have been no Moon landing program. The note on the bouquet read: “Mr. President, the Eagle has landed.” ([Location 9330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=9330))
- When pilots really get worried is when they run out of options and run out of time simultaneously. ([Location 10606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=10606))
- “Science is about what is; engineering is about what can be.” ([Location 11969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FCKGWK&location=11969))
