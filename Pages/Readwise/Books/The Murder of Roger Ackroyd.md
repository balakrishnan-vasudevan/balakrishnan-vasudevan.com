## Highlights
- “Les femmes,” generalized Poirot. “They are marvellous! They invent haphazard—and by miracle they are right. Not that it is that, really. Women observe subconsciously a thousand little details, without knowing that they are doing so. Their subconscious mind adds these little things together—and they call the result intuition. Me, I am very skilled in psychology. I know these things.” ([Location 2217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BXPYDBFP&location=2217))
