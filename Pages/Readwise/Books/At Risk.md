## Highlights
- An “invisible” was CIA-speak for the ultimate intelligence nightmare: the terrorist who, because he or she is an ethnic native of the target country, can cross its borders unchecked, move around that country unquestioned, and infiltrate its institutions with ease. An invisible was the worst possible news. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2PLU&location=211))
- “We’ve had a bit more background noise than usual. No specific indicators though. Nothing approaching the traffic you’d associate with a major operation.” ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2PLU&location=223))
- Marzipan’s name was Sohail Din, and he had been a walk-in. An exceptionally bright young man of Pakistani origin whose father was the comfortably-off proprietor of several Tottenham newsagents, he had been accepted to read law at Durham University. A devout Muslim, he had decided to spend his gap year working in a small Islamic bookshop in Haringey. The work was not well paid, but it was close to the family home, and Sohail had hoped that it would provide the opportunity for religious discussion with other serious-minded young men like himself. It had rapidly become clear, however, that the tone of the place was rather less moderate than it had seemed. The version of Islam celebrated by those who came and went was a long way from the compassionate creed that Sohail had absorbed at home and at his local mosque. Extremist views were aired as a matter of course, young men openly discussed their intentions of training as mujahidin and taking up the sword of jihad against the West, and there was jubilation every time the press reported that an American or Israeli target had been hit by terrorists. Unwilling to voice his dissent, but clear in his own mind that a world view which celebrated the murder of civilians was abhorrent before God, Sohail kept a low profile. Unlike his fellow employees, he saw no reason to hate the country of his birth, or to despise the legislature that he hoped one day to serve. The crunch came one late summer afternoon when three Arabic-speaking men had entered the shop from an elderly Mercedes. One of Sohail’s colleagues had nudged him, indicating the oldest of them—a nondescript figure with thinning hair and a scruffy beard. This, Sohail learned when the three men had been taken to the rooms above the shop, was Rahman al Masri, an important fighter. Perhaps his arrival meant that Britain would at last taste some of the terror inflicted by its Satanic ally, the United States. This was the point at which Sohail decided to act. At the day’s end he had not caught his customary bus home but instead, after consulting an A to Z, had taken a main-line train half a dozen stops south to Cambridge Heath. Exiting the railway station, having satisfied himself that he had not been followed, he had pulled up the hood of his coat and made his way through the drizzle to Bethnal Green police station. Special Branch had acted fast; Rahman al Masri was a known player. MI5 had been notified, an observation post had been set up near the bookshop, and when al Masri and his two minders left the following day, it was with a discreet surveillance escort. Intelligence allies had been informed, and with several countries working closely together, al Masri was allowed to run. He was eventually picked up at Dubai airport, and taken into custody by that country’s secret police. After a week of what was officially described as “intensive questioning,” al Masri admitted that he had visited London to deliver instructions to terrorist cells there.

- If he had sought her out after three years’ silence, however, and defied all the standard agent protocols by ringing the switchboard, it was just possible that he had something useful to tell her. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2PLU&location=917))
- From her earliest days with the service Liz had had an instinctive understanding of the dynamics of agent-running. At one end of the scale there were agents like Marzipan who informed on their colleagues out of patriotism or moral conviction, and at the other end there were those who worked strictly out of self-interest, or for cash. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2PLU&location=923))
- Every instinct that Liz possessed—every sensibility that she had fine-tuned in a decade of security intelligence work—whispered to her of threat. Pressed, she would have had difficulty in defining these feelings, which related to the way that particles of information combined and took shape in her subconscious. She had, however, learned to trust them. Learned that certain configurations—however fractured, however dimly seen—were invariably malign.

- “Symbolism and anniversaries are hugely important to the ITS,” said Mackay, recovering his authority. “September the eleventh was the anniversary of the British mandate in Palestine and of George Bush Senior’s proclamation of ‘New World Order.’ October the twelfth, when the Bali nightclub bombing and the attack on the USS Cole took place, was the anniversary of the opening of the Camp David peace talks between Egypt and Israel. This is more local and perhaps more personal, but I think we can count on them moving heaven and earth to stick to it.” ([Location 4695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC2PLU&location=4695))
