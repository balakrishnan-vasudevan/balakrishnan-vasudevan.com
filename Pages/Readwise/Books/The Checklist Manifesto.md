## Highlights
- “necessary fallibility”—some things we want to do are simply beyond our capacity. We are not omniscient or all-powerful. Even enhanced by technology, our physical and mental powers are limited. Much of the world and universe is—and will remain—outside our understanding and control. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=110))

- The first is ignorance—we may err because science has given us only a partial understanding of the world and how it works. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=114))

- The second type of failure the philosophers call ineptitude—because in these instances the knowledge exists, yet we fail to apply it correctly. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=116))

- the volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably. Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us. ([Location 181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=181))

- The philosophy is that you push the power of decision making out to the periphery and away from the center. You give people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise. All you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility. That is what works. ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=910))
- That routine requires balancing a number of virtues: freedom and discipline, craft and protocol, specialized ability and group collaboration. And for checklists to help achieve that balance, they have to take two almost opposing forms. They supply a set of checks to ensure the stupid but critical stuff is not overlooked, and they supply another set of checks to ensure people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances and unpredictabilities the best they know how. ([Location 993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=993))
- The researchers called it an “activation phenomenon.” Giving people a chance to say something at the start seemed to activate their sense of participation and responsibility and their willingness to speak up. ([Location 1367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1367))
- It had three “pause points,” as they are called in aviation—three points at which the team must stop to run through a set of checks before proceeding. There ([Location 1404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1404))
- Good checklists, on the other hand, are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything—a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead, they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps—the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1512))
- When you’re making a checklist, Boorman explained, you have a number of key decisions. You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed to be used ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1545))
- You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed to be used (unless the moment is obvious, like when a warning light goes on or an engine fails). You must decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO checklist. With a DO-CONFIRM checklist, he said, team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often separately. But then they stop. They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done. With a READ-DO checklist, on the other hand, people carry out the tasks as they check them off—it’s more like a recipe. So for any new checklist created from scratch, you have to pick the type that makes the most sense for the situation.

A rule of thumb some use is to keep it to between five and nine items, which is the limit of working memory. ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1546))

- It is common to misconceive how checklists function in complex lines of work. They are not comprehensive how-to guides, whether for building a skyscraper or getting a plane out of trouble. They are quick and simple tools aimed to buttress the skills of expert professionals. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=1619))
- All learned occupations have a definition of professionalism, a code of conduct. It is where they spell out their ideals and duties. The codes are sometimes stated, sometimes just understood. But they all have at least three common elements. First is an expectation of selflessness: that we who accept responsibility for others—whether we are doctors, lawyers, teachers, public authorities, soldiers, or pilots—will place the needs and concerns of those who depend on us above our own. Second is an expectation of skill: that we will aim for excellence in our knowledge and expertise. Third is an expectation of trustworthiness: that we will be responsible in our personal behavior toward our charges. Aviators, however, add a fourth expectation, discipline: discipline in following prudent procedure and in functioning with others. ([Location 2307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2307))
    - Note: Selflessness
      Skill
      Trustworthiness
- In the end, a checklist is only an aid. If it doesn’t aid, it’s not right. ([Location 2327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2327))
- He gives the example of a famous thought experiment of trying to build the world’s greatest car by assembling the world’s greatest car parts. We connect the engine of a Ferrari, the brakes of a Porsche, the suspension of a BMW, the body of a Volvo. “What we get, of course, is nothing close to a great car; we get a pile of very expensive junk.” ([Location 2341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0030V0PEW&location=2341))
