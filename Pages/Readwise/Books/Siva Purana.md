## Highlights
- The basic unit of life is the nimesha, the instant. Fifteen nimeshas make one kastha, thirty kasthas one kaala, thirty kaalas one muhurta and thirty muhurtas one day. Thirty days is a maasa, a month, which is one day of the gods and ancestors; six maasas make an ayana, two ayanas a year. One human year is a day and a night for the celestials, uttarayana being the day and dakshinayana the night. Three hundred and sixty-five human years make a divine one. Four are the yugas in the land of Bharata: the krita, treta, dwapara and kali. The pristine krita lasts 4,800 divine years, the less perfect treta 3,600 years, the half-corrupt dwapara 2,400 and the almost entirely evil kali 1,200. A chaturyuga, one cycle of four ages, is 12,000 godly years long, 12,000 x 365 human years. 71 chaturyugas make a manvantara, 14 manvantaras a kalpa. A kalpa, of 1000 chaturyugas, 12 million divine years, is one day of Brahma, the Creator. 8,000 years of Brahma make one Brahma yuga; 1,000 Brahma yugas make a savana. Each Brahma lives for 3,003 savanas. A day of Brahma’s has 14 Indras, his life 54,000 Indras. One day of Vishnu is the lifetime of Brahma. One day of Siva is the lifetime of Vishnu… ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A8623HE&location=48))
- Traditionally, a Purana deals with five subjects, called panchalakshana: the primary creation of the universe; secondary creation after periodic destruction; the genesis of the Gods and rishis; great epochs of time, the kalpas, manvantaras, yugas; and the history of some royal dynasties of the earth.

- There are 18 principal surviving Mahapuranas, great Puranas. The Siva Purana is one of these. ([Location 76](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A8623HE&location=76))
- "Siva alone is nishkaala, nameless and formless, as well as sakaala, embodied. In his formlessness, he is worshipped as the linga. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A8623HE&location=183))
