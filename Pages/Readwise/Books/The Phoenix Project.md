## Highlights
- I’ve figured out that the trick to a long career in it Operations management is to get enough seniority to get good things done but to keep your head low enough to avoid the political battles that make you inherently vulnerable. I have absolutely no interest in becoming one of the vps who just give each other PowerPoints all day long. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=105))
- if your colleague tells you they’ve decided to quit, it was voluntary. But when someone else tells you they’ve decided to quit, it was mandatory. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=110))
- He’s definitely a smart guy but can be intimidating because of how much he knows. What makes it worse is that he’s right most of the time. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=388))
- And so far, we’re basing everything on hearsay. That doesn’t work for solving crimes, and it definitely doesn’t work for solving outages. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=413))
- Situations like this only reinforce my deep suspicion of developers: They’re often carelessly breaking things and then disappearing, leaving Operations to clean up the mess. The only thing more dangerous than a developer is a developer conspiring with Security. The two working together gives us means, motive, and opportunity. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=465))
- First, you take an urgent date-driven project, where the shipment date cannot be delayed because of external commitments made to Wall Street or customers. Then you add a bunch of developers who use up all the time in the schedule, leaving no time for testing or operations deployment. And because no one is willing to slip the deployment date, everyone after Development has to take outrageous and unacceptable shortcuts to hit the date. The results are never pretty. Usually, the software product is so unstable and unusable that even the people who were screaming for it end up saying that it’s not worth shipping. And it’s always it Operations who still has to stay up all night, rebooting servers hourly to compensate for ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=712))
- crappy code, doing whatever heroics are required to hide from the rest of the world just how bad things really are. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=717))
- How can we manage production if we don’t know what the demand, priorities, status of work in process, and resource availability are? ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1033))
- start. We can’t make new commitments to other people when we don’t even know what our commitments are now!” ([Location 1052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1052))
- Was rebooting a server a change? Yes, because we don’t want anyone rebooting servers willy-nilly, especially if it’s running a critical service. How about turning off a server? Yes, for the same reason. How about turning on a server? No, we all thought. That is, until someone came up with the example of turning on a duplicate dhcp server, which screwed up the entire enterprise network for twenty-four hours.

- “a ‘change’ is any activity that is physical, logical, or virtual to applications, databases, operating systems, networks, or hardware that could impact services being delivered.” ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1212))
- “You probably don’t even see when work is committed to your organization. And if you can’t see it, you can’t manage it—let alone organize it, sequence it, and have any assurance that your resources can complete it.” ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1333))
- we now know that wip is one of the root causes for chronic due-date problems, quality issues, and expediters having to rejuggle priorities every day. ([Location 1353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1353))
- them: the Theory of Constraints, Lean production or the Toyota Production System, and Total Quality Management. ([Location 1356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1356))
- “Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt, who created the Theory of Constraints, showed us how any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion. ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1375))
- “Your job as vp of it Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure it service.” ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1389))
- “in order to get to where you want to go, eventually you will need to figure out what your equivalent to that desk is. You must figure out how to control the release of work into it Operations and, more importantly, ensure that your most constrained resources are doing only the work that serves the goal of the entire system, not just one silo. ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1395))
- “The First Way helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into it Operations, because that’s what’s between the business and the customer. The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework. And the Third Way shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery.” ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1398))
- We quickly create a list of the top ten most fragile services, applications, and infrastructure. Any change request that could affect any of these will be immediately flagged for cab scrutiny. ([Location 1550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1550))
- “We need to create some standard procedures around these changes—like when we’ll want them implemented—and have key resources not only aware of them but also standing by, just in case things go wrong—even the vendors.” ([Location 1552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1552))
- “Got it. For these types of changes, I’ll have my staff generate some reports on the changes’ success rates and any associated downtime. This will help the business make more informed decisions around the changes.” ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1561))
- “Excellent! The first ones are the low-risk changes that itil calls ‘standard changes.’ For changes we’ve done many times before successfully, we just preapprove. They still need to be submitted, but they can be scheduled without us.” ([Location 1571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1571))
- For the ‘messy middle changes,’ we’re deciding that the change submitter has responsibility and accountability for consulting and getting approval from people potentially affected. Once they do that, they submit their change card for us to review and approve for scheduling.” ([Location 1580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1580))
- “I want you to host practice incident calls and fire drills every two weeks. We need to get everyone used to solving problems in a methodical way and to have the timeline available before we go into that meeting. If we can’t do this during a prearranged drill, how can we expect people to do it during an emergency?” ([Location 1647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1647))
- Those projects certainly represent two categories of work: business projects and internal it projects. ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1701))
- changes are the third category of work. ([Location 1704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1704))
- If changes are a type of work different than projects, does that mean that we’re actually doing more than just the hundred projects? How many of these changes are to support one of the hundred projects? If it’s not supporting one of those, should we really be working on it? If we had exactly the amount of resources to take on all our project work, does this mean we might not have enough cycles to implement all these changes? ([Location 1710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1710))
- though. Every time that we let Brent fix something that none of us can replicate, Brent gets a little smarter, and the entire system gets dumber. We’ve got to put an end to that. ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=1817))
- A fellow nco in the Marines once told me that his priorities were the following: provider, parent, spouse, and change agent. In that order. ([Location 2475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2475))
- business projects, internal projects, and changes. ([Location 2529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2529))
- Unplanned work. ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2543))
- Unplanned work is what prevents you from doing it. Like matter and antimatter, in the presence of unplanned work, all planned work ignites with incandescent fury, incinerating everything around it. ([Location 2547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2547))
- Step 1 is to identify the constraint. You’ve done that, so congratulations. Keep challenging yourself to really make sure that’s your organizational constraint, because if you’re wrong, nothing you do will matter. Remember, any improvement not made at the constraint is just an illusion, yes? “Step 2 is to exploit the constraint,” he continues. “In other words, make sure that the constraint is not allowed to waste any time. Ever. It should never be waiting on any other resource for anything, and it should always be working on the highest priority commitment the it Operations organization has made to the rest of the enterprise. Always.” ([Location 2613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2613))
- which is to subordinate the constraint. In the Theory of Constraints, this is typically implemented by something called Drum-Buffer-Rope. ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2623))
- “Remember, outcomes are what matter—not the process, not controls, or, for that matter, what work you complete.” ([Location 2650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=2650))
- “She said that she would first look at the order and then look at the bill of materials and routings. Based on that, she would look at the loadings of the relevant work centers in the plant and then decide whether accepting the order would jeopardize any existing commitments. ([Location 3087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3087))
- I’m pretty sure we don’t do any sort of analysis of capacity and demand before we accept work. Which means we’re always scrambling, having to take shortcuts, which means more fragile applications in production. Which means more unplanned work and firefighting in the future. So, around and around we go.” To my surprise, Erik interrupts. “Well put, Bill. You’ve just described ‘technical debt’ that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts, which may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the compounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization doesn’t pay down its technical debt, every calorie in the organization can be spent just paying interest, in the form of unplanned work.” ([Location 3090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3090))
- “every work center is made up of four things: the machine, the man, the method, and the measures. ([Location 3344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3344))
- “The candidate projects which are safe to release are those that don’t require Brent.” ([Location 3379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3379))
- “What you’re building is the bill of materials for all the work that you do in it Operations. But instead of a list of parts and subassemblies, like moldings, screws, and casters, you’re cataloging all the prerequisites of what you need before you can complete the work—like laptop model numbers, specifications of user information, the software and licenses needed, their configurations, version information, the security and capacity and continuity requirements, yada yada…” ([Location 3386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3386))
- “Well, to be more accurate, you’re actually building a bill of resources. That’s the bill of materials along with the list of the required work centers and the routing. Once you have that, along with the work orders and your resources, you’ll finally be able to get a handle on what your capacity and demand is. This is what will enable you to finally know whether you can accept new work and then actually be able to schedule the work.” ([Location 3390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3390))
- “Properly elevating preventive work is at the heart of programs like Total Productive Maintenance, which has been embraced by the Lean Community. tpm insists that we do whatever it takes to assure machine availability by elevating maintenance. ([Location 3402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3402))
- ‘Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.’ The Third Way is all about ensuring that we’re continually putting tension into the system, so that we’re continually reinforcing habits and improving something. Resilience engineering tells us that we should routinely inject faults into the system, doing them frequently, to make them less painful. ([Location 3404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3404))
- Studies have shown that practicing five minutes daily is better than practicing once a week for three hours. And if you want to create a genuine culture of improvement, you must create those habits.” ([Location 3413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3413))
- handoffs. The wait time for a given resource is the percentage that resource is busy, divided by the percentage that resource is idle. ([Location 3417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3417))
- “A critical part of the Second Way is making wait times visible, so you know when your work spends days sitting in someone’s queue—or worse, when work has to go backward, because it doesn’t have all the parts or requires rework. ([Location 3423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3423))
- And they don’t do squat for scalability, availability, survivability, sustainability, security, supportability, or the defensibility of the organization.” ([Location 3450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3450))
- They have continual two-week improvement cycles, each requiring them to implement one small Plan-Do-Check-Act project to keep them marching toward the goal. ([Location 3666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3666))

- “What that graph says is that everyone needs idle time, or slack time. If no one has slack time, wip gets stuck in the system. Or more specifically, stuck in queues, just waiting.” ([Location 3795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3795))
- “To tell the truth is an act of love. To withhold the truth is an act of hate. Or worse, apathy.” ([Location 3893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=3893))
- Are we competitive? Understanding customer needs and wants: Do we know what to build? Product portfolio: Do we have the right products? r&d effectiveness: Can we build it effectively? Time to market: Can we ship it soon enough to matter? Sales pipeline: Can we convert products to interested prospects? Are we effective? ([Location 4021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4021))
- Customer on-time delivery: Are customers getting what we promised them? Customer retention: Are we gaining or losing customers? Sales forecast accuracy: Can we factor this into our sales planning process? ([Location 4026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4026))
- You must find where you’ve under-scoped it—where certain portions of the processes and technology you manage actively jeopardizes the achievement of business goals—as codified by Dick’s measurements. And secondly, John must find where he’s over-scoped it, such as all those sox-404 it controls that weren’t necessary to detect material errors in the financial statements. ([Location 4074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4074))
- “Some of the wisest auditors say that there are only three internal control objectives: to gain assurance for reliability of financial reporting, compliance with laws and regulations, and efficiency and effectiveness of operations. ([Location 4079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4079))
- All her project managers are gushing about how projects are flowing so much faster. The number of tasks waiting for Brent and the rest of it Operations is way down. In fact, if I’m reading the report correctly, Brent is almost caught up. On the project front, we’re in fantastic shape—especially with Phoenix. There’s another Phoenix deployment scheduled for Friday. It’s only a bunch of defect fixes, with no major functionality added or changed, so it should be much better than last time. We’ve completed all of our deliverables on time, but as usual, there are still a million details that still need to be worked out. I’m grateful that my team can stay so focused on Phoenix, because we’ve stabilized our infrastructure. When the inevitable outages and incidents do occur, we’re operating like a well-oiled machine. We’re building a body of tribal knowledge that’s helping us fix things faster than ever, and, when we do need to escalate, it’s controlled and orderly. Because of our ever-improving production monitoring of the infrastructure and applications, more often than not, we know about the incidents before the business does. Our project backlog has been cut way down, partially from eradicating dumb projects from our queue. And John has delivered. We’ve cut a bunch of unneeded security projects from our audit preparation and remediation work, replacing them with preventive security projects that my entire team is helping with. By modifying our development and deployment processes, we’re hardening and securing both the applications and production infrastructure in a meaningful and systematic way. And we’re gaining confidence that those defects will never happen again in the future. Our change management meetings are going more smoothly and regularly than ever. We not only have visibility into what our teams are doing, but work is really flowing. More than ever, people know exactly what they should be working on. People are getting satisfaction out of fixing things. I’m hearing that people are feeling happier and more upbeat, because they can actually do their jobs. It’s strange how much more clearly I see the it world now and how differently it looks to me than even a couple of months ago. Patty’s experiments with establishing kanbans around Brent are a success. We’re also finding instances of work going backward to Brent, because we didn’t understand or didn’t sufficiently specify some task or outcome, requiring Brent to translate or fix it. When this happens now, we quickly jump on it to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. And it’s not just Brent’s work that we’re improving. By reducing the number of projects in flight, we’re keeping clear lanes of work, so work can go from one work center to the other quickly, getting completed in record time. We’ve all but emptied our ticketing system of outdated work. In one case, we even found a ticket that Wes put in over ten years ago as a junior engineer, referring to some task for a machine that has… ([Location 4408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4408))
- We’re curbing the handoffs of defects to downstream work centers, managing the flow of work, setting the tempo by our constraints, and, based on our results from audit and from Dick, we’re understanding better than we ever have what is important versus what is not. ([Location 4439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4439))
- At the end, I led the retrospective portion, where we self-assessed how we did and the areas that we should improve. When someone mentioned that we should start inviting people from Development when we do our outage postmortem root cause analysis meetings, I realized that we… ([Location 4441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4441))
- a great team performs best when they practice. Practice creates habits, and habits create mastery of any process or skill. Whether it’s calisthenics, sports training, playing a musical instrument, or in my experience, the endless drilling we did in the Marines. Repetition,… ([Location 4444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4444))
- “In any system of work, the theoretical ideal is single-piece flow, which maximizes throughput and minimizes variance. You get there by continually reducing batch sizes. ([Location 4616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4616))
- “That’s ridiculous, given all the investments you’ve made virtualizing your production systems. You still do deployments like they’re physical servers. As Sensei Goldratt would say, you’ve deployed an amazing technology, but because you haven’t changed the way you work, you haven’t actually diminished a limitation.” ([Location 4620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4620))
- “A manufacturing plant is a system. The raw materials start on one side, and a million things need to go just right in order for it to leave as finished goods as scheduled out the other side. Everything works together. If any work center is warring with the other work centers, especially if Manufacturing is at war with Engineering, every inch of progress will be a struggle.” Erik turns to me, pointing, “You’ve got to stop thinking like a work center supervisor. You need to think bigger, like a plant manager. Or better yet, think like the person who designed this manufacturing plant and all of the processes it relies upon. They look at the entire flow of work, identify where the constraints are, and use every possible technology and bit of process knowledge they have to ensure work is performed effectively and efficiently. They harness their ‘inner-Allspaw.’” ([Location 4698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4698))
- “In manufacturing, we have a measure called takt time, which is the cycle time needed in order to keep up with customer demand. If any operation in the flow of work takes longer than the takt time, you will not be able to keep up with customer demand.” ([Location 4706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4706))
- “Allspaw taught us that Dev and Ops working together, along with qa and the business, are a super-tribe that can achieve amazing things. They also knew that until code is in production, no value is actually being generated, because it’s merely wip stuck in the system. He kept reducing the batch size, enabling fast feature flow. In part, he did this by ensuring environments were always available when they were needed. He automated the build and deployment process, recognizing that infrastructure could be treated as code, just like the application that Development ships. That enabled him to create a one-step environment creation and deploy procedure, just like we figured out a way to do one-step painting and curing. ([Location 4751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4751))
- “you need to create what Humble and Farley called a deployment pipeline. That’s your entire value stream from code check-in to production. That’s not an art. That’s production. You need to get everything in version control. Everything. Not just the code, but everything required to build the environment. Then you need to automate the entire environment creation process. You need a deployment pipeline where you can create test and production environments, and then deploy code into them, entirely on-demand. That’s how you reduce your setup times and eliminate errors, so you can finally match whatever rate of change Development sets the tempo at.” ([Location 4761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=4761))
- Like the legendary stories of the original Apple Mac os and Netflix cloud delivery infrastructure, we deployed code that routinely created large-scale faults, thus randomly killing processes or entire servers. ([Location 5287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=5287))
- We need to create a culture that reinforces the value of taking risks and learning from failure and the need for repetition and practice to create mastery. ([Location 5296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=5296))
- “You’ve helped me see that it is not merely a department. Instead, it’s pervasive, like electricity. It’s a skill, like being able to read or do math. Here at Parts Unlimited, we don’t have a centralized reading or math department—we expect everyone we hire to have some mastery of it. Understanding what technology can and can’t do has become a core competency that every part of this business must have. If any of my business managers are leading a team or a project without that skill, they will fail.” ([Location 5337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=5337))
- “A dysfunctional marriage assumes that the business and it are two separate entities. it should either be embedded into business operations or into the business. Voilà! There you go. No tension. No marriage, and maybe no it Department, either.” ([Location 5373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078Y98RG8&location=5373))
