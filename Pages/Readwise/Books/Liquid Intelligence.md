## Highlights
- The colder your drink is, the less sweet it tastes. Thus drinks served very cold—shaken cocktails—typically have more added sweetener than ones served warmer—stirred cocktails . . . and those shaken drinks seem to get sweeter if they are allowed to warm up.

- Shaken drink recipes cannot be used directly in a blender. Blend a standard shaken recipe and the result will be unbalanced—overtart, undersweet, and overdiluted. You can balance a drink recipe for a blender by adding more sugar and less acid. Fixing the dilution is more difficult. Most shaken drink recipes just have too much liquid in them to blend well. What to do? Reduce the liquid! ([Location 1858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00J8R3KOE&location=1858))
