- Blackjack which is the one way that you win automatically - the dealer deals you 21 or Blackjack! This would be an Ace and any card equal to 10 (10, Jack, Queen, King). You get paid immediately your hand is over. ([Location 153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=153))
- When you lose, the dealer immediately takes your money and the cards away. A push means you and the dealer tied and you keep your money. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=159))
- If the dealer is showing any number between 2 and 6 then you hit until you have 12. If the dealer is showing any number between 7 and the Ace, you hit until you have at least 17. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=198))
- A Blackjack is when you get 21 from the first two cards you are dealt. One card will be an Ace and one card will be a Ten, Jack, Queen or King. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=202))

- *Blackjack Superstition: If a dealer deals out an Ace, you’ll notice that the player who receives the card as well as some ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=214))
- of the others, and even sometimes the dealer, will tap or knock on the edge of the table or the felt twice. This is a superstitious move in hopes that a ten will show up to accommodate that Ace. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=215))
- If you are dealt two cards of the same value, you can split them by placing a second bet equal to your first one down. An initial $10 bet means you will need to put another $10 and split your cards ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=226))
- One of the challenges is when the dealer shows a five or six but the player has cards equaling 11 or less. Sure it may seem like the right move to hit but if that player gets their ten, they could get blamed for taking the dealer’s bust card if the dealer pulls out a win.

- You’ve got to know when to hold ‘em / Know when to fold ‘em / Know when to walk away / And know when to run ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5OQDN4&location=427))
