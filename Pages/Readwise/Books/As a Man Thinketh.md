- Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace. ([Location 31](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0082VKK5Y&location=31))
- "He that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;" ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0082VKK5Y&location=47))

- Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions, but when he realizes that he is a creative power, and that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes the rightful master of himself.

- Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself the shaper and author of environment. Even at birth the soul comes to its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own purity and, impurity, its strength and weakness.

- Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are. ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0082VKK5Y&location=84))
- Not what he wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonize with his thoughts and actions. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0082VKK5Y&location=87))
- Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0082VKK5Y&location=92))
