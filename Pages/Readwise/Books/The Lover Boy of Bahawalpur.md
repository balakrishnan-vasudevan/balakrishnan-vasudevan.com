## Highlights
- As Dar’s video statement went viral over social media, a Jaish spokesperson also contacted a local news organization in Kashmir, claiming responsibility for the attack. Immediately afterwards, the mobile phone used to make that call was traced by investigators to Rawalpindi in Pakistan but it was found to be switched off. The SIM card used to make the call was in the name of a Kashmiri woman who had already passed away. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=169))
- It was generally true that as compared to foreign terrorists who were well trained in camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Kashmiri militants did not have the same zeal and training. The foreigners, mostly Pakistanis, like the Mumbai terror attacker Ajmal Kasab, came from poor families and were filled with hatred in madrasas. They would hold in their minds an image of Kashmir that was far removed from reality. The stories they were told portrayed that the Muslim majority in Kashmir was getting brutalized by the Hindu majoritarian state of India. These would be as grim as how Muslims were not allowed to offer prayers in mosques and how the Hindus had occupied all the mosques. Motivated to take revenge to ‘save’ Islam, the jihadis would then be pushed across the border, in many cases to launch what came to be known as fidayeen attacks.

- In 2008, the J&K Police arrested one such foreign terrorist before he could carry out an attack. Upon receiving a tip-off from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), a police team raided a hotel in Delhi’s Paharganj area and arrested the man. After sustained interrogation, the man revealed that he had been trained in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and had been flown from Rawalpindi, Pakistan, to Dhaka, Bangladesh, from where he crossed into West Bengal, finally reaching Kolkata. The money for his launch, he said, was provided by a Pakistani national based in Singapore. In Kolkata he realized the stories he had been told in Pakistan were all lies. ‘Everywhere I went, even in visibly Hindu-dominated areas, I could hear the azaan rising from mosques all over,’ he would later tell his interrogators. When he was arrested in Delhi he had been inviting prostitutes to his room, arranged by a Hindu pimp. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=194))
- ‘Picchle kaam ka lutf uthao. Thoda itminaan rakho,’ he heard his uncle’s voice. The burly man in Bahawalpur asked his nephew to enjoy the fruits of his previous work and to be patient. Nothing was to be done right now. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=274))
- As Mudasir’s name surfaced again, the NIA began to look for him with fresh vigour. Investigators learned from an informant that he had been operating his WhatsApp through a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN allows a user to establish a private connection to the internet, masking the user’s internet protocol (IP) address with one provided by the VPN, making the user anonymous. Terrorists and their sympathizers use this to avoid getting tracked down by security agencies. A few days after the Pulwama suicide attack, Mudasir, they found out, had put up a WhatsApp status: ‘Who wants to be the next martyr?’ Another Jaish OGW, Bilal Ahmed Mir, had even responded to his status saying he wanted to be the next martyr. Bilal, it turned out from the messages tapped into by security agencies, was curious about who had carried out the Pulwama attack. In response to his question about it, Mudasir had sent Bilal a picture of the gelatine sticks used in making explosives. Later, the explosive examination report would confirm that three kinds of explosives – RDX, nitroglycerine (extracted from gelatine sticks) and ammonium nitrate – were used in the blast. The investigators were sceptical because prior to this they had not seen these explosives being used together. But the forensics were certain. They said they had tested the explosives several times and had come to the same conclusion every time. On 26 February, the NIA raided Mudasir’s house. ‘Convey to him the message that his days are numbered and if he does not surrender, he will soon be killed in an encounter,’ an NIA officer told Mudasir’s father. As they kept questioning him, Mudasir’s brother, a special needs boy, was hovering around them, oblivious to what they were there for. Mudasir’s father told the NIA officials that Mudasir had a fascination for uniforms and wanted to join the police. But he could offer no explanation as to why his son had chosen to go the other way. During questioning, the father reluctantly accepted that people had been congratulating him for his son’s actions. But Mudasir Khan and Sajjad Bhat were just the foot soldiers of the attack. The real masterminds were the burly man of Bahawalpur and the Jaish commander in the ajrak cap. But the NIA didn’t know this yet.

- Four days after the Pulwama attack, a man rode on a two-wheeler to a hilltop in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. In the upper pocket of his shirt he had a mobile phone that beamed a live video of the area to a facility in New Delhi. The man was doing so on behalf of a handler from India’s foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). The government had made clear to the security top brass on the evening of the Pulwama attack itself that it wanted to retaliate. The RAW had been asked to identify targets inside Pakistani territory that could be attacked. In response, the agency came up with three potential targets. One of them was a terrorist training camp just across the LoC in J&K. The government rejected this option immediately.

- When the RAW asset in Pakistan who would help to get images and exact coordinates of the camp was consulted, he told the RAW a vignette from Balakot’s history. It is here in 1831 that the Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s troops killed Syed Ahmed Barelvi, a man whose dreams of establishing an Islamic caliphate preceded those of Islamist organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and who was ‘the first person to realize the necessity of a movement which was at the same time religious, military and political’.** Barelvi lies buried in Balakot, a fact not lost on organizations like the Jaish that chose the place to set up… ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=334))
- In Pakistan, Indian intelligence assets reported how the fugitive Dawood Ibrahim was getting jittery in Karachi as he thought he may be targeted by India. ‘He was begging Pakistanis to shift him to Islamabad. But the Pakistanis refused as it would be difficult to explain his presence there. Instead, they shifted him to a secure bunker in Karachi itself,’ said a source. The option of killing Dawood Ibrahim was also put in front of the government. But the consensus, said the source, was that Dawood was a spent force and his killing would hardly send any message.

- Around the same time, a few other potential targets in Pakistan were searched on Google from various locations in India. The intelligence agencies of both countries keep an eye on locations in their country that are searched on Google in the other country. ‘Let us say that if we found Parliament searched several times in Pakistan, it would send alarm bells ringing here,’ said a senior Indian official. The RAW was deliberately… ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=341))

- The RAW assets reported that the several injured persons were taken to different hospitals so that the total number did not get leaked. ‘We know that many of the injured who could have been saved died because they were not taken to the hospital,’ revealed a source.

- ‘Asalam waleykum,’ wrote the commander. ‘Jeete raho,’ replied the burly man. ‘Why did you let go of the Indian pilot?’ ‘This is all politics, my dear. Do not worry too much about it.’ ‘We want the war to happen. Once the border opens, all of our fighters can easily step in and defeat the infidels.’ ‘Yes, yes. Listen, we need to hit them once more. Get it organized in a few weeks.’ ‘Okay, no problem. Listen, that money still hasn’t reached me.’ ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=360))
- Shortly after Mudasir was killed the burly man in Bahawalpur received a message on his mobile from the Sindhi ajrak topi–wearing Jaish commander. ‘The Indian media now thinks that Mudasir was the mastermind,’ the commander said. ‘They are making a fool out of their people.’ The burly man chuckled. ‘Unko gumraah rakho (keep them astray),’ the burly man replied. ‘May Allah be with you,’ he signed off. The attack the burly man had told the Sindhi topi wearing–commander to organize a few weeks after the Pulwama strike had to be held off. ‘Listen, we need to cancel the hit. There is too much pressure,’ the burly man of Bahawalpur said. ‘But why? We are all ready.’ ‘There is too much international spotlight on us.’ ‘Accha.’ Okay. ‘This thing has ended up helping Modi instead of damaging him. Now the fauj is after our people. Too many soldiers have died.’ ‘Nuksaan utna hi hona chahiye jitna dushman ko bardasht karne ki taaqat ho,’ the burly man said. The loss should be only as much as the enemy can absorb. ‘Agli karwahi ki ijazat bilkul nahin hai abhi,’ he signed off. There is absolutely no permission for the next action. 5 ‘The Army of Mohammed’ in South Kashmir ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=380))
- By 2004, Pulwama district had around fifty active Jaish terrorists. The senior commanders always came from Pakistan, well trained in camps there. Sometimes they would miss the food they were used to and ask their Kashmiri OGWs to arrange it for them. In 2004, the police kept a watch on a small hotel on the outskirts of Tral town, where a police informer said biryani was being cooked in bulk. ‘The Kashmiris did not care for biryani. So we knew some Punjabi Pakistani commander must have asked for it,’ said a police officer who served in South Kashmir in those days. Eventually, it led to the busting of a Jaish hideout.

- Masood Azhar was born in 1968 in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, to a religious teacher; Masood was the third boy among his eleven children. When he was eleven, Masood was enrolled in an influential madrasa in Binori town near Karachi city. From there, he was sent for military training to a camp in Khost, Afghanistan. But he was short and fat and totally unfit for the rigour of military training, so much so that he could not even complete the basic training. But even as he had failed there, he had impressed his handlers with his knowledge of scriptures and teaching skills. He also had an ability to make rousing speeches, which terrorist commanders of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), a group formed in the 1980s to fight the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan, found useful. The HuM encouraged him to travel, and in the early 1990s, he visited twenty-five countries in Africa, Europe and elsewhere to collect funds for jihad. In this endeavour, by all accounts, he was a success. A month after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in December 1992, Azhar was sent to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by his handlers to meet a veteran militant commander, Sajjad Afghani, who had fought alongside the mujahideen against Soviet forces. Afghani had been witness to Azhar’s embarrassing performance at Khost. But now, both had been asked to travel to Kashmir to launch a new wave of jihad there. Afghani went to Dhaka first, and from there he crossed over into West Bengal, finally reaching Kashmir. Azhar reached Delhi a few days later by air from Dhaka on a Portuguese passport, masquerading as a businessman. The immigration officer at the airport told Azhar that he did not look like a Portuguese citizen, to which he replied that he was originally from Gujarat. In Delhi, Azhar spent a night at the Ashok Hotel and then travelled to Lucknow, en route to Ayodhya. In his sermons later, Azhar would refer repeatedly to Ayodhya. He said that the ruins of the mosque there made him very angry and that he had vowed to restore it to its former glory. From Uttar Pradesh, Azhar reached Jammu and then finally the Kashmir Valley, where his first sermon was held at a hideout in South Kashmir’s Anantnag district in 1994. By 1994, the first wave of militancy, which began in 1988–89, had, as mentioned earlier, suffered a setback. Most of the original militants were either dead or had joined the Indian side. Added to this, the Hizbul Mujahideen, which had taken over from the JKLF as the dominant terrorist organization, was in the doldrums over the waning sentiment among many Kashmiris for azaadi. That day in 1994 at that secret Anantnag location, Azhar addressed two dozen armed terrorists, asking them, in the rhetorical style that was his hallmark, to launch an all-out war against India. Azhar’s stay in Kashmir proved to be extremely short. Just two days later, while travelling to another place with Afghani, their car broke down. Upon hailing an autorickshaw, he was spotted by security forces who… ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B097MGFLC1&location=545))
- Ansar was initially not willing to cooperate; he was ready to die. But the BSF had found that Pakistani terrorists could not bear it if they were stripped. Ansar had the same fear. ‘Shoot me, but do not strip me, please,’ he pleaded. But Dubey knew that was the only way he could get things out of him. So, he persisted.
