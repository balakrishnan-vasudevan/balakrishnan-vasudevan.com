## Highlights
- Harry thinks he’s reached a state of grace where business no longer matters to him, but he will always be someone who sees enemies around him. If it came to it, the only side he can choose is his own. Lana is motivated by abandonment-fueled anger and a desire for meaning, but those are dangerous and unstable emotions. Trust will never come into play, but I believe I can channel and control both Harry’s and Lana’s mind-sets to my advantage.” ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004NNUX6G&location=1307))
