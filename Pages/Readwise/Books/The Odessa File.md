## Highlights
- It is always tempting to wonder what would have happened if…or if not. Usually it is a futile exercise, for what might have been is the greatest of all the mysteries. But it is probably accurate to say that if Miller had not had his radio on that night he would not have pulled in to the side of the road for half an hour. He would not have seen the ambulance, or heard of Salomon Tauber or Eduard Roschmann, and forty months later the republic of Israel would probably have ceased to exist.

- Hans Appler, formerly a Jewish expert in the Nazi Propaganda Ministry of Dr. Josef Goebbels. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=330))
- Ludwig Heiden, also working in the Orientation Ministry. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=333))
- Shamseddin Badran, personal aide to Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer, later to become Vice-President of Egypt before being accused of treason after the Six-Day War of 1967 and later committing suicide. The other was Colonel Ali Samir, head of the Moukhabarat, the Egyptian Secret Intelligence Service. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=335))
- The host at the convivial meeting outside Cairo that night, having filled his guests’ glasses, turned back to the sideboard to top up his own. His name was Wolfgang Lutz, born at Mannheim in 1921, a former major in the German Army, a fanatical Jew-hater who had emigrated to Cairo in 1961 and started his riding academy. Blond, blue-eyed, hawk-faced, he was a top favorite among both the influential political figures of Cairo and the expatriate German and mainly Nazi community along the banks of the Nile. He turned to face the room and gave a broad smile. If there was anything false about that smile, no one noticed it. But it was false. He had been born a Jew in Mannheim but had emigrated to Palestine in 1933 at the age of twelve. His name was Ze’ev, and he held the rank of rav-seren (major) in the Israeli Army. He was also the top agent of Israeli Intelligence in Egypt at that time. On February 28, 1965, after a raid on his home in which a radio transmitter was discovered in the bathroom scales, he was arrested. Tried on June 26, 1965, he was sentenced to hard labor in perpetuity. Released after the end of the 1967 war as part of an exchange against thousands of Egyptian prisoners of war, he and his wife stepped back onto the soil of home at Lod Airport on February 4, 1968.

- It was my first sight of SS Captain Eduard Roschmann. ([Location 575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=575))
- The airline passenger that January night had been born Richard Glücks, later to become full general of the SS, head of the Reich Economic Administration Main Office, and Hitler’s Inspector General of Concentration Camps. On the wanted lists of West Germany and Israel, he was number three after Martin Bormann and the former chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=959))
- He stared out of his office window and thought back to the image of SS General Glücks facing him in a Madrid hotel room more than thirty days earlier, and to the general’s warning about the vital importance of maintaining at all costs the anonymity and security of the radio-factory owner now preparing, under the code name Vulkan, the guidance systems for the Egyptian rockets. Alone in Germany, he also knew that in an earlier part of his life Vulkan had been better known under his real name of Eduard Roschmann. ([Location 1834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=1834))
- Among the chief Scarlet Pimpernels of Rome who spirited thousands away to safety was Bishop Alois Hudal, the German Bishop in Rome. The main hiding-out station for the SS killers was the enormous Franciscan monastery in Rome, where they were hidden and boarded until papers could be arranged, along with a passage to South America. In some cases the SS men traveled on Red Cross travel documents, issued through the intervention of the Vatican, and in many cases the charitable organization Caritas paid for their tickets.

- Leon shook his head. “There’s no question of your trying to persuade former SS men you are one of them under your own name. For one thing, they have lists of former SS men, and Peter Miller is not on that list. For another, you have to age ten years at least. It can be done, but it involves a completely new identity, and a real identity. The identity of a man who really existed and was in the SS. That alone means a lot of research by us, and the expenditure of a lot of time and trouble.” “Do you think you can find such a man?” asked Miller. Leon shrugged. “It would have to be a man whose death cannot be checked out,” he said. “Before the Odessa accepts a man at all, it checks him out. You have to pass all the tests. That also means you will have to live for five or six weeks with a genuine former SS man who can teach you the folklore, the technical terms, the phraseology, the behavior patterns. Fortunately, we know such a man.” Miller was amazed. “Why should he do such a thing?” “The man I have in mind is an odd character. He is a genuine SS captain who sincerely regretted what was done. He experienced remorse. Later he was inside the Odessa and passed information about wanted Nazis to the authorities. He would be doing so still, but he was ‘shopped’ and was lucky to escape with his life. Now he lives under a new name, in a house outside Bayreuth.” “What else would I have to learn?” “Everything about your new identity. Where he was born, his date of birth, how he got into the SS, where he trained, where he served, his unit, his commanding officer, his entire history from the end of the war onward. You will also have to be vouched for by a guarantor. That will not be easy. A lot of time and trouble will have to be spent on you, Herr Miller. Once you are in, there will be no pulling back.” “What’s in this for you?” asked Miller suspiciously. Leon rose and paced the carpet. “Revenge,” he said simply. “Like you, we want Roschmann. But we want more. The worst of the SS killers are living under false names. We want those names. That’s what’s in it for us.” “That sounds like information that might be of use to Israeli Intelligence,” said Miller. ([Location 2650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2650))
- “They were both Jewish,” said Leon shortly. “We tried to get the tattoos from the concentration camps off their arms, but they left scars. Besides, they were both circumcised. That was why, when Motti reported to me on a genuine Aryan German with a grudge against the SS, I was interested. By the way, are you circumcised?” ([Location 2672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2672))
- “In the morning we will drive you to Beyreuth, and you will meet our SS officer. His name is Alfred Oster. He’s the man you will live with. I will arrange it. Meanwhile, excuse me. I have to start looking for a new name and identity for you.” ([Location 2686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2686))
- Peter Miller wrote his letters to his mother and Sigi under the watchful eye of Motti, and finished by midmorning. His luggage had arrived from his hotel, the bill had been paid, and shortly before noon the two of them, accompanied by the driver of the previous night, set off for Bayreuth. With a reporter’s instinct he flashed a glance at the number plates of the blue Opel which had taken the place of the Mercedes that had been used the night before. Motti, at his side, noticed the glance and smiled. “Don’t bother,” he said. “It’s a hired car, taken out in a false name.” “Well, it’s nice to know one is among professionals,” said Miller. Motti shrugged. “We have to be. It’s one way of staying alive when you’re up against the Odessa.” The garage had two berths, and Miller noticed his own Jaguar in the second slot. Half-melted snow from the previous night had formed puddles beneath the wheels, and the sleek black bodywork gleamed in the electric light. ([Location 2701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2701))
- Miller nodded. “That’s right,” he said. Oster turned on him. “Well, we’ll start by getting a few basic facts rights. I don’t know where you did your military service, but I suspect it was in that ill-disciplined, democratic, wet-nursing shambles that calls itself the new German Army. Here’s the first fact. The new German Army would have lasted exactly ten seconds against any crack regiment of the British, Americans, or Russians during the last war. Whereas the Waffen SS, man for man, could beat the shit out of five times their own number of Allies of the last war. “Here’s the second fact. The Waffen SS were the toughest, best-trained, best-disciplined, smartest, fittest bunch of soldiers who ever went into battle in the history of this planet. Whatever they did can’t change that. So smarten up, Miller. So long as you are in this house, this is the procedure. “When I walk into a room, you leap to attention. And I mean LEAP. When I walk past, you smack those heels together and remain at attention until I am five paces beyond you. When I say something to you that needs an answer, you reply, ‘Jawohl, Herr Haupsturmführer.’ And when I give an order or an instruction, you reply, ‘Zu Befehl, Herr Haupsturmführer.’ Is that clearly understood?” Miller nodded in amazement. “Heels together,” roared Oster. “I want to hear the leather smack. All right, since we may not have much time, we’ll press on, starting from tonight. Before supper we’ll tackle the ranks, from private up to full general. You’ll learn the titles, mode of address, and collar insignia of every SS rank that ever existed. Then we’ll go on to the various types of uniform used, the differing branches of the SS and their different insignia, the occasions when gala uniform, full-dress uniform, walking-out uniform, combat uniform, and fatigue dress would be worn. “After that I’ll put you through the full political-ideological course that you would have undergone at Dachau SS training camp, had you been there. Then you’ll learn the marching songs, the drinking songs, and the various unit songs. “I can get you as far as your departure from training camp for your first posting. After that Leon has to tell me what unit you were supposed to have joined, where you worked, under which commanding officer, what happened to you at the end of the war, how you have passed your time since nineteen forty-five. However, the first part of the training will take from two to three weeks, and that’s a crash course. “By the way, don’t think this is a joke. If you are once inside the Odessa, knowing who the top men are, and you make one slip in procedure, you’ll end up in a canal. Believe me, I’m no milksop, and after betraying the Odessa, even I’m running scared of them. That’s why I live here under a new name.” For the first time since he had set off on his one-man hunt for Eduard Roschmann, Miller wondered if he had not already gone too far. ([Location 2727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2727))
- It was January 13 before the news of the death in Bremen five days earlier of Rolf Günther Kolb reached Leon in Munich. The letter from his North German representative enclosed the dead man’s driving license. Leon checked the man’s rank and number on his list of former SS men, checked the West German wanted list and saw that Kolb was not on it, spent some time gazing at the face on the driving license, and made his decision. He called Motti, who was on duty at the telephone exchange where he worked, and the assistant reported to Leon when he had finished his shift. Leon laid Kolb’s driving license in front of him. “That’s the man we need,” he said. “He was a staff sergeant at the age of nineteen, promoted just before the war ended. They must have been very short of material. Kolb’s face and Miller’s don’t match, even if Miller were made up, which is a procedure I don’t like anyway. It’s too easy to see through at close range. But the height and build fit with Miller. So we’ll need a new photograph. That can wait. To cover the photograph we’ll need a replica of the stamp of the Bremen Police Traffic Department. See to it.” When Motti had gone, Leon dialed a number in Bremen and gave further orders. ([Location 2777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2777))
- The intern sat on one of the chairs and flicked through the dossier. It revealed simply that Kolb had collapsed in the street and been brought in by ambulance. An examination had diagnosed cancer of the intestine in a virulent and terminal form. A decision had later been made not to operate. The patient had been put on a series of drugs, without any hope, and later on painkillers. The last sheet in the file stated simply: “Patient deceased on the night of January 8/9. Cause of death: carcinoma of the main intestine. No next of kin. Corpus delicti delivered to the municipal mortuary January 10.” It was signed by the doctor in charge of the case. The new intern eased the last sheet out of the file and inserted in its place one of his own. The new sheet read: “Despite serious condition of patient on admission, the carcinoma responded to a treatment of drugs and went into recession. Patient was adjudged fit to be transferred on January 16. At his own request he was transferred by ambulance for convalescence at the Arcadia Clinic, Delmenhorst.” The signature was an illegible scrawl. The intern gave the file back to the filing clerk, thanked her with a smile, and left. It was January 22. ([Location 2809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2809))
- Three days later Leon received a piece of information that filled in the last section of his private jigsaw puzzle. A clerk in a ticket agency in North Germany sent a message to say a certain bakery proprietor in Bremerhaven had just confirmed bookings on a winter cruise for himself and his wife. The pair would be touring the Caribbean for four weeks, leaving from Bremerhaven on Sunday, February 16. Leon knew the man to have been a colonel of the SS during the war, and a member of Odessa after it. He ordered Motti to go out and buy a book of instructions on the art of making bread. ([Location 2818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2818))
- “Pretty good,” said Oster. “I gave him a two-hour interrogation yesterday, and he could pass. Until someone starts asking for specific details of his career. Then he knows nothing.” Leon nodded for a while, examining some papers he had taken from his attaché case. “We don’t know Kolb’s career with the SS,” he said. “It couldn’t have been very much, for he’s not on any wanted list and nobody has ever heard of him. In a way that’s just as well, for the chances are the Odessa has never heard of him either. But the disadvantage is, he has no reason to seek refuge and help from the Odessa unless he is being pursued. So we have invented a career for him. Here it is.” He passed the sheets over to Oster, who began to read them. When he had finished he nodded. “It’s good,” he said. “It all fits with the known facts. And it would be enough to get him arrested if he were exposed.” ([Location 2854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2854))
- Leon grunted with satisfaction. “That’s what you have to teach him. Incidentally, we have found a guarantor for him. A man in Bremerhaven, a former SS colonel, is going on a sea cruise, starting February sixteenth. The man is now a bakery owner. When Miller presents himself, which must be after February sixteenth, he will have a letter from this man assuring the Odessa that Kolb, his employee, is genuinely a former SS man and genuinely in trouble. By that time the bakery owner will be on the high seas and uncontactable. By the way”—he turned to Miller and passed a book across to him—“you can learn baking as well. That’s what you have been since nineteen forty-five, an employee in a bakery.” He did not mention that the bakery owner would be away for only four weeks, and that after that period Miller’s life would hang by a thread. ([Location 2862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2862))
- “Right. Here is your driving license, complete with your photograph as you now look. You can tell anyone who asks that you drive a Volkswagen but you have left it in Bremen, as the number could identify you to the police.” Miller scanned the driving license. It showed himself with his short hair but no mustache. The one he now had could simply be explained as a precaution, grown since he was identified. “The man who, unknown to him, is your guarantor left from Bremerhaven on a cruise ship on the morning tide. This is the former SS colonel, now a bakery owner and your former employer. His name is Joachim Eberhardt. Here is a letter from him to the man you are going to see. The paper is genuine, taken from his office. The signature is a perfect forgery. The letter tells its recipient that you are a good former SS man, reliable, now fallen on misfortune after being recognized, and it asks the recipient to help you acquire a new set of papers and a new identity.” Leon passed the letter across to Miller. He read it and put it back in its envelope. “Now seal it,” said Leon. Miller did so. “Who’s the man I have to present myself to?” he asked. Leon held out a sheet of paper with a name and address on it. “This is the man,” he said. “He lives in Nuremberg. We’re not certain what he was in the war, for he almost certainly has a new name. However, of one thing we are quite certain. He is very high up in the Odessa. He may have met Eberhardt, who is a big wheel in the Odessa in North Germany. So here is a photograph of Eberhardt the baker. Study it, in case your man asks for a description of him from you. Got that?” Miller looked at Eberhardt’s photograph and nodded. “When you are ready, I suggest a wait of a few days until Eberhardt’s ship is beyond the reach of ship-to-shore radio-telephone. We don’t want the man you will see to get through a telephone call to Eberhardt while the ship is still off the German coast. Wait till it’s in mid-Atlantic. I think you should probably present yourself on next Thursday morning.” Miller nodded. “All right, Thursday it is.” “Two last things,” said Leon. “Apart from trying to trace Roschmann, which is your desire, we also would like some information. We want to know who is now recruiting scientists to go to Egypt and develop Nasser’s rockets for him. The recruiting is being done by the Odessa, here in Germany. We need to know specifically who the new chief recruiting officer is. Secondly, stay in touch. Use public telephones and phone this number.” He passed a piece of paper across to Miller. “The number will always be manned, even if I am not there. Report in whenever you get anything.” Twenty minutes later, the group was gone. ([Location 2946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=2946))
- He crossed the passage and entered his study. From the telephone information operator he elicited the numbers of the Eberhardt Bakery, the Bremen General Hospital, and the Arcadia Clinic at Delmenhorst. He called the bakery first. Eberhardt’s secretary was most helpful. “I’m afraid Herr Eberhardt is away, sir. No, he can’t be contacted. He has taken his usual winter cruise to the Caribbean with Frau Eberhardt. He’ll be back in four weeks. Can I be of any assistance?” The lawyer assured her she could not and hung up. Next he dialed the Bremen General and asked for Personnel and Staff. “This is the Department of Social Security, Pensions Section,” he said smoothly. “I just wanted to confirm that you have a ward orderly on the staff by the name of Hartstein.” There was a pause while the girl at the other end went through the staff file. “Yes, we do,” she said. “David Hartstein.” “Thank you,” said the lawyer in Nuremberg and hung up. He dialed the same number again and asked for the registrar’s office. “This is the secretary of the Eberhardt Baking Company,” he said. “I just wanted to check on the progress of one of our staff who has been in your hospital with a tumor in the intestine. Can you tell me of his progress? Rolf Günther Kolb.” There was another pause. The girl filing clerk got out the file on Rolf Günther Kolb and glanced at the last page. “He’s been discharged,” she told the caller. “His condition improved to a point where he could be transferred to a convalescent clinic.” “Excellent,” said the lawyer. “I’ve been away on my annual skiing vacation, so I haven’t caught up yet. Can you tell me which clinic?” “The Arcadia, at Delmenhorst,” said the girl. The lawyer hung up again and dialed the Arcadia Clinic. A girl answered. After listening to the request, she turned to the doctor by her side. She covered the mouthpiece. “There’s a question about that man you mentioned to me, Kolb,” she said. The doctor took the telephone. “Yes,” he said. “This is the Chief of the Clinic. I am Doctor Braun. Can I help you?” At the name of Braun the secretary shot a puzzled glance at her employer. Without batting an eyelash, he listened to the voice from Nuremburg and replied smoothly, “I’m afraid Herr Kolb discharged himself last Friday afternoon. Most irregular, but there was nothing I could do to prevent him. Yes, that’s right. He was transferred here from the Bremen General. A tumor, well on the way to recovery.” He listened for a moment, then said, “Not at all. Glad I could be of help to you.” The doctor, whose real name was Rosemayer, hung up and then dialed a Munich number. Without preamble he said, “Someone’s been on the phone asking about Kolb. The checking up has started.” ([Location 3122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=3122))
- Where were you born?” “Bremen, sir.” “Right. Place of birth is in your SS records. I just checked. Were you in the Hitler Youth?” “Yes, sir. Entered at the age of ten in nineteen thirty-five, sir.” “Your parents were good National Socialists?” “Yessir, both of them.” “What happened to them?” “They were killed in the great bombing of Bremen.” “When were you inducted into the SS?” “Spring nineteen forty-four, sir. Age eighteen.” “Where did you train?” “Dachau SS training camp, sir.” “You had your blood group tattooed under your right armpit?” “No, sir. And it would have been the left armpit.” “Why weren’t you tattooed?” “Well, sir, we were due to pass out of training camp in August nineteen forty-four and go to our first posting in a unit of the Waffen SS. Then in July a large group of officers involved in the plot against the Führer was sent down to Flossenburg camp. Flossenburg asked for immediate troops from Dachau training camp to increase the staff at Flossenburg. I and about a dozen others were singled out as cases of special aptitude and sent straight there. We missed our tattooing and the formal passing-out parade of our draft. The commandant said the blood group was not necessary, as we would never get to the front, sir.” The lawyer nodded. No doubt the commandant had also been aware in July 1944 that, with the Allies well into France, the war was drawing to a close. “Did you get your dagger?” “Yes, sir. From the hands of the commandant.” “What are the words on it?” “Blood and Honor, sir.” “What kind of training did you get at Dachau?” “Complete military training, sir, and political-ideological training to supplement that of the Hitler Youth.” “Did you learn the songs?” “Yessir.” “What was the book of marching songs from which the ‘Horst Wessel Song’ was drawn?” “The album Time of Struggle for the Nation, sir.” “Where was Dachau training camp?” “Ten miles north of Munich, sir. Three miles from the concentration camp of the same name.” “What was your uniform?” “Gray-green tunic and breeches, jackboots, black collar lapels, rank on the left one, black leather belt, and gunmetal buckle.” “The motto on the buckle?” “A swastika in the center, ringed with the words ‘My honor is loyalty,’ sir.” The lawyer rose and stretched. He lit up a cigar and strolled to the window. “Now you’ll tell me about Flossenburg camp, Staff Sergeant Kolb. Where was it?” “On the border of Bavaria and Thuringia, sir.” “When was it opened?” “In nineteen thirty-four, sir. One of the first for the pigs who opposed the Führer.” “How large was it?” “When I was there, sir, three hundred meters by three hundred. It was ringed by nineteen watchtowers with heavy and light machine guns mounted. It had a roll-call square one-twenty meters by one-forty. God, we had some fun there with them Yids—” “Stick to the point,” snapped the lawyer. “What were the accommodations?” “Twenty-four barracks, a kitchen for the inmates, a washhouse, a sanatorium, and various workshops.” “And for the… ([Location 3156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0085DOJLU&location=3156))
- It would be agreeable if things in this world always finished with all the ends neatly tied up. That is very seldom the case. People go on, to live and die in their own appointed time and place. So far as it has been possible to establish, this is what happened to the main characters. Peter Miller went home, married, and stuck to reporting the sort of things that people want to read over breakfast and in the hairdresser’s. By the summer of 1970 Sigi was carrying their third child. The men of the Odessa scattered. Eduard Roschmann’s wife returned home and later received a cable from her husband telling her he was in Argentina. She refused to follow him. In the summer of 1965 she wrote to him at their old address, the Villa Jerbal, to ask him for a divorce before the Argentinian courts.
