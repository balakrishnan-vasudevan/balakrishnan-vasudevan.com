## Highlights
- Between March 1993 and July 2006, the city witnessed a dozen bomb attacks of varying intensity which used improvised explosive devices (IEDs), some fashioned out of sophisticated plastic explosives with timer switches, others pressure cookers modified with locally procured ammonium nitrate. These bomb attacks had killed 516 citizens and injured 1,952. ([Location 66](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=66))

- The twelve sequential bomb attacks of 12 March1993 accounted for the city’s largest body count: 257. The plastic explosives were packed in vehicles parked near the Bombay Stock Exchange; the Air India building; inside a double-decker city bus that passed near the regional passport office; at a petrol pump near the Shiv Sena Bhavan, the cream-coloured, four-storey headquarters of the right-wing political party, at three five-star hotels; a cinema in central Mumbai; and at the Zaveri Bazaar in central Mumbai. Hand grenades were flung at the tarmac of the Sahar International Airport and the fishermen’s colony in Mahim, suburban Mumbai. Jeeps, cars and scooters were turned into bombs using a shipment of nearly 1.5 tonnes of RDX. The deadly plastic explosive came from Karachi. It was landed using boats on a deserted coastline on the mainland south-east of Mumbai. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=70))

- There were ten other bomb attacks of varying intensity between 1993 and 2003. On 25 August 2003, fifty-two persons died in twin blasts at the Gateway of India and at the Zaveri Bazaar, a crowded market in central Mumbai. It was the largest attack since 1993. Three years later, the horror returned. In July 2006, 200 persons were killed in seven blasts inside the city’s lifeline, its commuter trains. Yet, these attacks had failed to shatter the city’s standing as India’s financial hub or deter its citizenry. The attacks were anonymous and faceless. The city had never known the terror of gun-wielding assailants. ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=84))

- The nineteen youth worked for Ibrahim Mushtaq Abdul Razak ‘Tiger’ Memon, a Dawood Ibrahim lieutenant. Tiger Memon instructed them to storm the Mantralaya, headquarters of the state administration in south Mumbai; the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) building near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) station; and the Shiv Sena headquarters. They were to inflict maximum casualties using the Type 56 rifles and hand grenades. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=91))

- Phase 2 was never implemented. In the melee that followed the blasts, these youth panicked. Their leaders, Bashir Khan and Anwar Theba, fled. They abandoned their cache – assault rifles, pistols, ammunition and hand grenades near Mumbai’s famous Siddhivinayak temple at Worli. Possibly it was because they were leaderless: the main conspirator, Tiger Memon, had fled to Dubai just hours before the serial blasts.

- The police were armed with the .303 Lee Enfield rifle and its single-shot Indian improvisation, the .410 musket. The iconic .303 had first seen action in the second Boer War in 1899. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=120))

- Mumbai seemed uneasily insulated against a peculiar and deadly Metropolitan terror which had intensified by 2008. In May that year, nine serial blasts in marketplaces in Jaipur killed sixty-three persons. Eight low-intensity blasts in Bangalore in July killed two persons and seventeen serial blasts in Ahmedabad the same month killed twenty-nine persons. Twenty-one persons were killed in five serial blasts in Delhi’s busy markets on 13 September. Each attack was immediately preceded by a triumphant email from the Indian Mujahideen, ostensibly a home-grown terrorist outfit, claiming credit for the attacks.

- The Ram Pradhan committee that probed the Mumbai police’s response to the attack mentioned a total of twenty-six intelligence alerts which warned of major terrorist attacks. ([Location 145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=145))

- On 26 June, the additional commissioner of the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) informed Vishwas Nangre-Patil, the deputy commissioner of police in charge of the Mumbai police’s Zone 1, that two terrorists might have entered India in May 2008 and may well be in Mumbai. Only one of the targets the alert mentioned – a temple near Shivaji Park in Dadar – fell outside Nangre-Patil’s precinct which extended from Marine Drive to Colaba. The targets included a site code-named Leopold, the Bombay High Court, the director general of police’s office located near the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and the offices of the Department of Atomic Energy building next to it. Nangre-Patil immediately alerted Deepak Vishwasrao, the senior police inspector in charge of the Colaba Police Station.

- On 24 September, the IB informed the Maharashtra director general of police Anami Roy that the Lashkar-e- Toiba (LeT) had been showing ‘interest’ in launching attacks on Mumbai. The list of possible targets included the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, the Sardar Vallabhai Patel Stadium, the Sea Rock Hotel and the Taj Land’s End the last two located in Bandra, the JW Marriot Hotel in Juhu and the Juhu Aerodrome in suburban Mumbai. This alert was passed on to the police commissioner the following day. Four days later, Nangre-Patil and Senior PI Vishwasrao visited the Taj. The officers met the hotel general manager Karambir Kang, the security manager Sunil Kudiyadi and Mahavir Singh Rathod, security head of all Taj hotels. They discussed the various threat scenarios – a suicide attack, planting of VBIEDs and explosives. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=160))

- The policemen had come with a list of suggestions to beef up security. They wanted the CCTV systems of both Taj buildings to be integrated and manned continuously. Only one gate of the hotel should be kept open with door frame metal detectors, they advised. On 30 September, the two police officers were back at the hotel. This time, they briefed hotel authorities on the model security instructions issued for the Bombay Stock Exchange building where eighty-four persons had died in the March 1993 attacks. On 2 October, Nangre-Patil detailed twenty-six steps to augment the Taj’s security. In a letter to Senior PI Deepak Vishwasrao, Nangre-Patil suggested positioning snipers on the terrace of the Taj, police guards at the entrance, integrating the CCTVs of both wings and manning them round the clock and installing door frame metal detectors to check visitors at the entrance. Nangre-Patil also suggested closing the hotel’s Northcote gate, an open entrance at the southern end of the old wing named for a nursing home that stood across the road. This unguarded entrance led visitors into the heart of the hotel. On 16 October, the senior police inspector wrote to Nangre-Patil to report that the hotel management… ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=165))

- On 30 October, the combined operations room in the coastal town of Vadinar, Gujarat, flashed an alert to the Central intelligence agencies in Delhi. The alert was extremely unusual because the Ops Room, a grouping of navy, coast guard, Intelligence Bureau, Border Security Force and army representatives, rarely issued such warnings. The alert said that thirty terrorists were crossing over for an attack within the next thirty days. Mumbai was not… ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=176))

- On nights like this, there were usually dozens of fisherfolk like him around. But tonight they were all in their homes watching Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma hammer the English bowling attack in the fifth One-Day International cricket match in Cuttack’s Barabati stadium. The fifty-one-year-old fisherman didn’t care. He hated cricket. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=186))

- These ten men – soon to be the familiar faces in India as the Mumbai terror attackers – set sail from Karachi on 22 November on board a small cargo vessel, the Al-Husseini owned by the Lashkar-e-Toiba military commander Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi.

- Founded by a radical Ahle-Hadith preacher Hafiz Mohammed Saeed in 1990, it was a Janus-faced organization. Its charitable arm, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, ran schools and hospitals across Pakistan. Its military arm, the LeT, recruited and trained Pakistani civilians, mostly from its largest province, Punjab, through three-month-long guerrilla courses in paramilitary camps. They were then infiltrated across a heavily militarized and disputed 740-km Line of Control (LOC) to fight Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Unlike other militant groups, the LeT was distinctly proximate to the Pakistan army. Every LeT leader was ‘handled’ by a serving officer from the Pakistan army’s Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence or ISI. So enmeshed was the LeT with the state, and so vital were they to calibrate its secret war in Kashmir, that they were often called ‘sarkari mujahid’ (government holy warriors) inside Pakistan.

- 21.38 hours / Taj Palace Abu Rehman Bada (alias Hafiz Arshad) and Abu Ali (alias Javed) had meanwhile emerged from their taxi near the Gateway of India after slipping a timed explosive device under the driver’s seat. They entered the fragrant, opulent lobby of the Taj Mahal Palace with its faraway tinkle of music and unhurried sybaritic buzz. Hafiz and Javed could have passed off for any of the several backpacking tourists in the hotel. They glided into the lobby and turned left into a granite-lined corridor, flanked by a Louis Vuitton store and the hotel reception counter manned by the courteous, impeccably attired saree-clad executives. The corridor led deep into the old wing. The 5’10”-tall and well-built Hafiz, sporting a red baseball hat, stopped halfway down the corridor and pulled an AK-47 out of the bag, calmly inserted a pair of magazines and cocked his weapon. Javed followed his lead. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00PFWH4RU&location=304))
