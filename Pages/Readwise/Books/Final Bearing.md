## Highlights
- "Skipper!" the young petty officer sitting at the ISAR radar yelled excitedly. "Pop-up contact bearing two-one-seven, range seven miles. Signature of a periscope. Contact designate Romeo two-six.” "Roger, Sheppard," Lieutenant Jim Pruitt answered. "Good work. Stay locked onto him." Shifting from the intercom to a voice radio frequency, Pruitt reported the contact with their quarry for this exercise. "Mission Control, Victor-Four-Tango. Pop-up contact on ISAR. Possible hostile sub. Going in for MAD run." ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=527))
- "Heads up, everybody. We're making a MAD run then we’ll do a drop. Sensors, let me know what you get." The P-3C was about to make use of the world’s largest metal detector. They weren’t looking for lost change or jewelry on the beach. This mechanism was designed to detect a far bigger and more deadly find in the ocean below. Jess Carmon, riding in the sensor operator seat on the other side of the bulkhead behind the co-pilot, heeded the skipper’s words, pressing the headset even more tightly to his ears with both hands. His eyes never left the needle on the meter in front of him as he watched for the smallest sign of movement. All the way aft in the P-3C, a twenty-foot-long boom protruded from the tail of the aircraft. Inside the boom, extremely sensitive coils sensed the earth's magnetic field. Those coils were wired to the needle in front of Carmon. As long as the plane flew over open ocean, the needle rested straight up. If the coils passed near a large metal object, the needle would swing wildly. As Victor-Four-Tango roared over the spot where they had lost the radar contact, Carmon’s eyes grew wide as he watched the needle swing all the way to the left peg then to the right peg before again coming to rest in the middle of the dial. He yelled, "Madman! Madman!" the signal that there was a submarine directly below where they had just flown. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=540))
- Fifteen feet aft of the control room, in a small, narrow cubicle illuminated only by dim, bluish lights, Master Chief Sonarman Ray Mendoza searched the waters around Spadefish, trying to detect the sound of anything that might pose a threat to the boat. He watched the display of his discrete frequency analyzer as it showed him the four Pratt and Whitney turbo-props as they passed overhead the first time, then again when the plane came back around. There was another sound. There was no mistaking the splash of the Mark 50 torpedo when it hit the water. He heard the distinctive whine of the torpedo’s lithium metal-powered SCEPS engine as it came up to speed and sent the projectile plowing through the water, in pursuit of Spadefish. Mendoza’s broadband display began to show a depiction of the torpedo’s noise on its screen. The sounds were unequivocal. Sweat poured from the sonar man’s forehead and trickled down his back as he grabbed the 27-MC microphone. "Conn, Sonar. Torpedo in the water! Bearing zero-three-three!" Ward grabbed the 1MC microphone and shouted, "Torpedo in the water!" This announcement kicked off another automatic response from the crew. Chief Lyman rang up "Ahead Flank" on the engine order telegraph. Scott Frost, the throttleman, spun open the large, chrome, ahead-throttle as fast as he could manage, his breath rasping as he worked furiously. Steam roared into both of the massive main engines as they whined up to maximum speed. The seventeen-foot-diameter bronze screw at the rear of the boat, weighing better than thirty tons, was now spinning at over two-hundred-and-fifty revolutions per minute. Spadefish leaped ahead, accelerating her forty-seven hundred tons to almost thirty knots. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=595))
- The captain yelled to Chief Ralston, "Shoot the evasion device in the after signal ejector! Reload and shoot again!" Spadefish raced along at a depth of three hundred feet. The cavitation, the tiny collapsing bubbles at the back edges of the fairwater planes, sounded for all the world like hail hammering on a tin roof. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=622))
- Chief Ralston reached over and flipped a switch. The electric light indicator for the seawater hull valve for the signal ejector changed briefly from "Shut" to "Open," then back to "Shut." All the way aft, in the port side of the engine room, a small cylinder that looked very much like a miniature torpedo tube, pushed its contents out into the sub's slipstream. The evasion device tumbled backward, past the screw, and generated a wall of noise in the water that was intended to hide the racing sub and its whirling propeller from the “ears” of the oncoming torpedo. Mendoza shouted into the 27MC microphone, "Evasion device functioning. Torpedo bears zero-three-three.” There was a pause. “It just blew right on past the device!" The evasive device had not deterred the torpedo. The unflappable Master Chief was shaking as he watched on the sonar screen as the torpedo’s trace merged with the one for Spadefish.

- "Eng, slow to one-third. Let him pass us out here where the channel is wider. Get well over to the right side of the channel. He'll need a lot of room." Kuhn nodded, "Aye, sir." He spoke into the mike. "Helm ahead one-third. Steer course three-five-six. Rig out the outboard, test and shift to remote. Make the anchor ready for letting go, snubbing scope thirty fathoms. Have line handlers lay topside." That set of rapid-fire orders called a host of people into action. Down in the bowels of the auxiliary machinery room, just aft of the reactor compartment, an electrician used a series of controls to lower a small electric motor-driven outboard from the ballast tank. The little outboard, like a trolling motor on a bass boat, projected below the keel. The motor could be trained through 360 degrees to help nudge Spadefish in any direction. The electrician checked to make sure the equipment was operating and shifted control to the helmsman. Seaman Cortez saw the "Remote Control" light come on and tested to verify he had control of the outboard. "Bridge, Helm. Outboard lowered, tested and shifted to remote." All the way aft in the engine room, beside the massive spinning shaft, Bill Ralston struggled to make the anchor ready to drop. It was a piece of gear that was almost never used. In all his years on the boats, Ralston had never seen it dropped except when it was being tested alongside the pier. The anchor windlass on Spadefish, like a lot of her equipment, was old and cranky. Ralston muttered under his breath as he fought the stubborn gear. "I hope this damn thing works if we ever need it," he growled, but no one heard him. Finally, he had it lined up so that only the chain-brake had to be loosened and then the anchor would drop from its position in the ballast tank below him. He reached over and set the out-haul windlass so it would pay out only thirty fathoms of chain. Contrary to what most people believe, it isn’t the anchor itself that holds a ship in place. The mass of chain lying on the bottom of the ocean does most of the work. With ten feet of water under the keel, they needed thirty fathoms of chain to hold Spadefish firmly in place. Ralston grabbed the 7MC microphone. "Bridge, anchor. Anchor ready for letting go. Snubbing scope three-zero fathoms. Skipper, we need to lower the anchor and walk out the chain once we're in port this time so we can loosen her up. She's getting real sluggish." "Okay, Chief,” Ward answered. “We should have plenty of time to play with it this time." "Skipper," the engineer was saying as he looked up at Ward. "Request permission to open the weapons shipping hatch and send men topside." ([Location 1145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=1145))
- Ward acknowledged and looked back and down at the main deck, just behind the sail. He saw the large hatch swing up and the COB hop up onto the deck. He immediately attached a hook into a groove on the deck. That hook was attached to a harness he was wearing and connected him to the boat. The round deck was treacherously slick. Maneuvering the boat to rescue a man who slipped and fell overboard was dangerous in these tight waters. The COB watched as each man through the hatch attached his safety harness to the track before going to his assigned task. Ward leaned over the side of the sail and called down, "COB, rig out the cleats and both capstans. Take the tug alongside at the port number three cleat to bring the pilot onboard, then cast him off so he's clear before that ‘ro-ro’ gets here." Master Chief Lawskowski yelled back up, "Aye, sir," and turned to his team of line handlers, telling them what the skipper had ordered. They were going to get the harbor pilot off his tug and aboard Spadefish before the hulking cargo ship and its wake got too close. It was only a few moments before the large orange-and-mustard-yellow commercial tug pulled alongside and tossed over a light head line. The civilian pilot leaped over to the main deck of the submarine and scurried up the steel ladder rungs to the bridge. "Afternoon, Captain! Glad to see you back," he said cheerfully, a warm smile on his face as he shook Ward’s outstretched hand. ([Location 1167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=1167))
- The American spy satellites would never find this place. The nearest road was over five miles away, the jungle nearly impenetrable. It was hardly more than a rutted trail. The only reliable way in was by water, and that was a grueling trip up a swift-flowing river. All the supplies, every piece of equipment, had been carried in by boat. Then through the tangled rain forest on the backs of a few of the local peasants. They only moved on dark, cloudy nights. These men were intensely loyal to the revolution. And they were sworn to secrecy on the threat of death to their families. All precautions had been taken to assure the place would be nearly impossible to detect. The diesel generator that supplied the essential electricity was buried in the jungle a half-mile away. Even its exhaust pipe ended beneath the water of the river so the satellite infrared sensors would not be able to see its heat and raise suspicion. Building this lab had taken many months and much money, but it was key to de Santiago's plan. The design was ingenious. Two-feet-thick insulation was hidden below the rusting roof inside of the shed to further defeat the infrared sensors. Ventilation piping ran underground for several hundred yards before exiting. Ninety percent of the lab was underground, protected from any sensing devices de Santiago or any of his advisors could imagine. A government patrol that might stumble upon the abandoned hacienda would be very lucky to find the lab. If they did, a carefully designed protective system would assure their accidental discovery was a deadly one without doing serious damage to the wonder it was designed to defend.

- The SEALs had developed this technique years ago to allow them to jump into hostile territory without the dangerous necessity of having their mother plane fly low over the landing zone, making it and its cargo of jumpers an easy target for ground fire. Instead, they jumped from a high-flying plane and did a long free fall in the direction of the landing zone. This particular maneuver was called a “HALO” jump. It was possible to cover over a hundred miles this way. This was the "HA" or "high altitude" part of it. It required very specialized survival equipment for the harsh, frigid environment they had to endure during the initial portion of the jump. Still, the "LO" or "low opening" was the most dangerous part of the procedure. To limit the amount of time any radar had a chance of detecting the large aerodynamic parachutes, they didn't open them until they were within fifteen hundred feet of the ground. That meant over fifty thousand feet of free fall, ten minutes of dropping all alone through an icy, pitch-black sky. A HALO jump took extraordinary nerves and discipline. Even on a clear night, when the jumper could see the ground below and the stars above, the urge to pull the cord became nearly unbearable. Jumping into a thick cloud cover notched up the stress level to an entirely different plateau. Up, down, left, right, it all became meaningless. There was no reference point to use. The SEALs had to rely entirely on the instruments strapped to their arms, a compass for direction, an altimeter and a timer, all on one forearm. On the other were a small GPS receiver and the jump computer. As they fell earthward, the thick clouds enveloped each of them. Nothing visible. No stars, no ground, no friends in sight dropping through the night with them. Watch the compass. Make the course corrections that the computer and GPS called for. Listen for the beep of the altimeter and try not to remember that the lowest bidder manufactured it. ([Location 2356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=2356))
- Of all the members of de Santiago’s inner circle, he was the one who had the most difficulty dismissing the threat of El Falcone. He, of all de Santiago’s staff, understood the nature of one who was privy to such sensitive information and was so willing to share it with the enemy. He only regretted that the leader had not allowed him to pursue the spy himself. It was his job after all. But de Santiago had been adamant on that subject. Of one thing he was certain; El Falcone would know about the party this night aboard the riverboat. If he did, so did the enemy. Marquez again tried to dismiss his fears, smiled and kissed his wife again, then led her past the other guests to the stern of the boat. The big paddlewheel was pushing them upriver now, its splashes igniting soft phosphorescence in the water. The lights of the town were easing away, dimming in the soft mist of the warm evening. Now, away from the lights, the stars overhead were brilliant, the sky vast and dark. Then Marquez saw something. Something that made his heart stop for a moment. There, standing side by side on the wharf from which the boat had moved away a few moments before, was Juan de Santiago and Guzman. They were quietly watching the boat steam upriver, not waving or hailing them to come back. Why would the boat leave without the host of the party on board? Guillermo Marquez realized the answer to his question only an instant before the deck buckled beneath his feet. Before the massive explosion ripped the doomed vessel apart. Before white, hot fire devoured the entire world. ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=2959))
- Ward broke the mood. "Steve, the message is ready in Radio. Raise the BRA-34 and transmit. As soon as you have receipt acknowledged, go to four-hundred feet and flank, course zero-nine-zero." They would head eastward, assuming help would come from the closest point of land. "Aye, sir. Chief of the Watch, raise number two BRA-34. Tell radio to transmit the released message when ready." Sam Bechtal, the Chief of the Watch, flipped a switch high up on the control panel he faced. A small green "housed" light flashed out and a red "up" light flashed on, indicating the antenna was out of its sheath and ready. "Number two BRA-34 indicates ‘up.’" Friedman heard a quick burst of static from a speaker behind him, hooked to an Intercept Receiver on the periscope. Radio had sent the message. Cortez listened on the phone headset he wore. Turning to Friedman, he reported, "Officer of the Deck, Radio reports message sent and acknowledged. No longer need the BRA-34." "Chief of the Watch, lower all masts and antennas!” Friedman ordered crisply. “Diving Officer, make your depth four-hundred feet." He slapped up the handles on the scope and reached for the red control ring. The scope slid smoothly back down into the well.

- "Mister Sui, it is a simple logistics problem. Because we made the special hull modifications to the mother transport, she can only steam at a maximum speed of fifteen knots." De Santiago stopped at the huge fireplace at one end of the room, turned and headed toward the other end again at a quick march. He did not breathe hard at all and the exertion had cleared his mind of his earlier frustrations. "If we steam that ship all the way to Thailand and back, the submarine would have to wait for over a month on the bottom of the sea. It doesn't have the endurance. It would also delay getting your product to your customers. And our distribution network is most anxious to go to work for us." Sui sipped from his cup of tea. "I see. Hmmm. Couldn't the transport bring the sub with it, then launch it once it was in position off the U.S. coast?" "That would be technically possible. However, we felt that would raise suspicions with the Americans, or with anyone else who might accidentally see the operation. A transport manifested for Thailand loitering off the Washington coast, doing something strange with a mini-submarine? No, it is better for us to steam out to the mid-Pacific and meet your transport halfway, make the transfer, then come back with the product. A little paint and it becomes another cargo ship, maybe heading toward South America from Siberia. Meanwhile, the mini-sub is delivering our cocaine first, then heading northward for the transfer of your product off the Pacific Northwest coast." Sui stroked his chin thoughtfully.

- Inside Spadefish’s control room, the Quartermaster had already turned off the bright white fluorescent lights and switched on the dim red ones, “rigged control for red.” Doc Marston was little more than a shadowy form, seated at the ballast control panel over to the port side of the control room. In a quiet voice, his tone seemingly dictated by the half-light, Durgan ordered, "Raise the ESM mast." Marston stood, reaching high up on the vertical section of the panel to flip a switch. "ESM mast coming up," he confirmed. One of the bars of green lights that were lined up in a row in front of him blinked out. Durgan knew that the light said "ESM mast housed," but he was too far away to read the tiny letters. Now, Durgan spun around to take a look aft and down at the faint phosphorescent wake of the scope. He was just in time to see a strangely shaped object break the dark surface of the sea. It looked like a black beer barrel with a flat hat and bent rods sticking out at odd angles. "ESM mast breaking the water." Joe Glass, sitting on a bench locker in the ESM bay forty feet aft, watched as Al Carlos and Dan Larson carefully adjusted their electronic equipment, like a couple of piano tuners trying to strike only perfect notes. Glass heard Chris Durgan's voice over the open microphone system, which had been installed years before. It picked up voices in the vicinity of the periscope so the ESM watch could hear what was going on. Likewise, the microphone above Glass's head allowed Durgan to just as clearly eavesdrop on conversations in ESM. The ESM bay constituted the after half of the radio room. Even in the highly classified atmosphere of Spadefish, the radio room was special territory. It was the only room onboard that was kept permanently locked. Only crew members with a special clearance and a “need-to-know” were given the seven-digit code necessary to open the cipher-locked door. The real secrets of the room were in this back corner. Spadefish and her sisters of the Sturgeon class had been designed more as spy ships than as offensive weapons. With their endurance and stealth, they could sit off the coast of an unsuspecting country for months at a time without being detected. The sophisticated sensors housed in this room allowed her to sweep the electronic spectrum, gathering, decrypting, translating, and interpreting.

- During the long years of the Cold War, several of these boats were always on station, just outside the territorial limits of the old USSR, hidden but listening attentively. It had been a very dangerous game of cat and mouse. The secrets that had been gathered in this room and others on boats like it had helped to win that war. The “Silent Service” had certainly lived up to its name, and even now, few knew of its contributions to the eventual fall of the Soviet Union. Larson looked up from the tiny CRT. The squiggly lines on its green screen commanded his complete attention, despite the tight quarters. He faced a bulkhead crowded with a myriad of black boxes, barely inches away. Another bulkhead behind his crouched form was equally close and similarly cluttered with equipment. The blue overhead light gave the packed out closet a surreal glow. Dan Larson, his eyes shining, glanced over at Glass. "Got a signal already, XO. Looks like the receivers are working." Al Carlos sat on a bench locker, facing the other way. He wore a headset and fiddled with a tiny keyboard on the vertical face of one of the black boxes. His face was scrunched up, his mouth crooked as he listened hard. He finally glanced sideways at Larson. "Dan, you may be gettin’ sumthin’, but I ain't got squat." He punched some of the buttons in front of him once again. "You sure, Al?" Larson asked. "You think I'm deaf? ‘Course, I'm sure." Larson looked over at the shorter, darker technician. The two had worked as a team for years and had the easy familiarity of an old married couple, but with the same tendency for nagging. These two men weren't part of the normal Spadefish crew. They were special hitchhikers. "Spooks," the crew called them, on loan from the Naval Intelligence Service. They were specially trained to operate this equipment and to analyze its output. Sometimes they rode the boats, sometimes they flew in specially equipped planes, and often they manned lonely listening posts on hilltops far from civilization. "Okay, okay,” Larson said with a wave of a hand. “Ain't nothing between you and me except for four feet of coaxial cable. Everything hooked up right?" Carlos reached behind his black box and felt around for dangling connectors or non-plugged sockets. "Yep, all hooked up over here." "Time to go to the last line o' the troubleshootin’ manual then, buddy." Carlos looked at his friend, his brow furrowed. "What that be?" "It's highly technical,” Larson said with a smile. “It says, 'Wiggle here, wiggle there, wiggle, wiggle everywhere.’" Carlos laughed. "You damn hillbilly! You fished me in again." Larson reached behind the black box he was watching. Grabbing one of the cables attached to it, he gave it a vigorous shake and a sharp tug. Carlos held his headset tightly to his ears. "I could hear snatches of signal. The BNC connector must be bad. I’ll swap the whole cable." Carlos fished a new cable from a nearby locker and tied the faulty one into a knot so it wouldn’t… ([Location 3676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=3676))
- Margarita, the mistress of Juan de Santiago, smiled. She returned the tiny earpiece to its hiding place beneath the bed. No one would dare look there for any spy device. Juan de Santiago's bed was off limits to everyone but her and El Jefe himself. She, the room, and the bed were beyond the suspicion of the most ambitious security expert. The snippet of one-sided conversation she had heard had been quite interesting. It could prove very valuable in the future. Margarita decided she would keep this information to herself, only to be used if she needed to. No, El Falcone would not pass the bit of treachery she had just heard along to the JDIA until it was most opportune. Her purposes would be better served at some point in sharing it with El Jefe himself. Margarita pulled on her swimsuit, checked her form in the floor-to-ceiling mirror, then headed for the hallway, calling the children’s names as she made her way down to the pool. ([Location 3980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=3980))
- More work for El Falcone, he decided. Sure wish he wasn’t such a pain-in-the-ass to contact. Even in the best of times, communications were tenuous with the spy. Bethea had no way to directly contact him. He could only place a specially worded ad in a Cartagena newspaper and wait for El Falcone to check in. He would need to put that into the works, too. That is, as soon as he had Ward and his sub on the way to their next job. ([Location 4437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=4437))
- “Not yet, XO. We need to get inside of five hundred yards for that. Is Chief Mendoza reporting the near-field effect yet?” Near-field effect was a sonar phenomenon caused by the very close range to the contact. The sonar would begin seeing the freighter as a number of different noise sources rather than as one composite source. The result was that they would begin to see many lower-noise-strength contacts on several different bearings. Before submariners figured out this occurrence, more than one skipper collided with the contact or broken off the approach in total confusion. Near-field effect started to be seen at about five hundred yards from the target. “Sonar reports they are starting to see near-field now,” Glass responded. “The contact is shifting to upper D/Es, now at plus six.” D/E, or depression/elevation angle, measured the angle between horizontal and the incoming sonar noise. The D/E was normally a negative number. A close contact above them would result in a positive D/E. This was also a good sign that they really were deeper than the Helena K’s keel. It was crucial that they remain so. ([Location 4646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=4646))
- Margarita slipped quietly back into the bedroom. Juan de Santiago was gone, off to eat and carouse with his lackeys and gloat over the latest brilliant move he was making to counter the setbacks he had recently suffered. She eased the door shut behind her. She locked it. She reached underneath the bed and removed the miniature recorder. Juan had been using the bedside phone. He had destroyed all his cell phones, had ripped all the wall phones away from their cables in his fits of anger. Everything he had said would be on the tape. She looked at her face in the mirror, at her eyes. The hate she felt for the man with whom she slept smoldered in her eyes. It would be so easy to end his life now. To one night interrupt his grunting with the blade of her stiletto while he was on top of her, bragging of those he had killed even as he pushed and shoved himself into her. It was not the time. He would only become a martyr and his organization would be even stronger. It would be better to help destroy all he had built first. Then, when the time was right, she could end his reign in a second. That would be such a sweet day. It was time for El Falcone to once again send more information to the JDIA, to drive one more nail into Juan de Santiago’s coffin. ([Location 4798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=4798))
- The towed array was a very sensitive line of sonar hydrophones towed almost a mile behind Spadefish, like a thick sausage at the end of a long string. The reel for the cable was up in the forward port side of the bow compartment. The array, roughly six inches in diameter and two hundred feet long, was housed in a tube that snaked along the sub’s hull and ended at the after edge of the port stabilizer when it was stowed. When in use, the array was far behind Spadefish’s own noise and that greatly increased its sensitivity. The hydrophones were tuned to detect very low frequency sounds in the water, allowing for long-range work. The one drawback was the cable. If the submarine backed down while the array was deployed, her great bronze screw could easily slice right through it. Then a two-million-dollar piece of equipment would sink slowly to the bottom of the sea. “Okay, Skipper. I have a handle on what’s happening. Why don’t you grab some chow and hit the rack? Cookie has some great sticky buns in the oven for breakfast.” ([Location 5006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=5006))
- He pointedly picked up a thick file from beneath an empty doughnut platter on the table. The legend across the file read, ‘Top Secret, Highly Sensitive Sources” in two-inch-tall red letters. Bethea put on a pair of half-rim glasses, opened the file, and began looking for something in its contents. “Chief Johnston and I both recognize the code words for a ‘spy,’” Beaman said. “I hope this particular spy is a good one. I’m too tired to go trekking through the jungle on some wild goose chase. And, in case you haven’t heard, they play pretty rough down there these days.” Bethea looked out over the top of his reading glasses. He fixed Beaman with a quizzical stare. Beaman felt like a rabbit caught in the glare of a hungry wolf. “Oh, he’s good all right. El Falcone seems to have access to very valid information. You might be interested in what he has to say here. It concerns your old friend, Juan de Santiago.” Beaman perked up. “Hardly an old friend.” “Seems he and one of his lieutenants rode on horseback though the jungle last night for an important meeting. Bethea turned to the map. “Right there in the middle of that circle. That meeting is happening as we speak. Unfortunately, El Falcone could not give us enough lead time to get any assets on the ground to observe the meeting more closely.” “You got a bird in the sky over them?” Johnston asked. Bethea pulled a couple of aerial photos out of the file and scooted them across the table to both men. “Funny you should ask. You can see from this that the area is pretty wild. That first one is visible spectrum. Nothing but jungle and some old, burned-out ruins of some kind of plantation that’s disappearing into the undergrowth. The second photo is near infrared. Nothing there either. Not even a stray body. Those two were taken early this morning. These two were taken an hour later. You can see two riders and horses quite plainly on the IR shot. We’re now keeping the site under near constant satellite surveillance. If El Falcone is correct, something is going on, and that’s a spot we need to investigate farther.” Johnston carefully laid down the photograph he was scrutinizing. He looked across the table at Bethea and asked the question both SEALs were thinking. “Why go there? Million miles from anywhere and nothing but some pretty tough jungle?” Bethea smiled. “Exactly, Chief. Why go there? De Santiago has a million choices if he just wants a secure, hidden site for some kind of a strategy meeting. All easier to get to than this one is. If it was simply a meeting place, we think he would pick one of those, or just hold it right there in his own hacienda like he usually does. He’s arrogant enough to think we don’t have ears there. But we’ve seen his propensity for hiding major facilities in very out-of-the-way places. You guys certainly have, first hand. I’m betting he has something important to him hidden near here. And as you might have suspected already, I want you to go in and find out what it is.” “But… ([Location 5063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=5063))
- “That damn Japanese sub has to be around here someplace. I feel like we’ve searched every square inch of water between SoCal and Hawaii. He has to be hiding in the noise of that freighter.” He pointed downward at a darker gray silhouette that was pitching and bucking on a gray, rolling sea, struggling to the northwest. “Let’s take a look. Sensors ready to drop another search pattern? We’ll drop ten thousand yards in front of it and let it steam through the pattern.” Dalton looked over his shoulder, back down the passageway of the old plane. Jess Carmon gave him a thumbs-up. “Yep, Skipper. Ready to drop in auto as soon as you arm the pickle. I’m sure glad we’re up here and not down there in that crap.” Rain lashed across the windshield of the low flying aircraft. It bumped and yawed with the wind. It was far rougher down there on the ocean’s surface. Pruitt lifted up the small red cover from over a switch on his right control handle then flipped it on. “Pickle is hot. Steady course two-seven-five.” Priutt heard Carmon’s voice coming crisply over the headset. “Stand by for auto-pattern drop. Stand by. Commencing drop now.” The P-3C flew on through the rain and clouds. Six sonobuoys were ejected from beneath the aircraft, one after another, in a computer-controlled sequence. The AN/SSQ-53 DIFAR sonobuoys parachuted to the water below then dropped a hydrophone on a long wire to listen deep under the storm-tossed Pacific. The main body of the buoy stayed on the surface, bobbing about in the churning seas. A thin wire antenna shot out of the top of each one. Carmon spoke into his microphone. “Skipper, I have six live buoys on the link, but I don’t know how long I can keep them in this sea state.” “Just do the best you can, Jess. We’ll go back upstairs to do an ISAR search. Shep, keep your eyes peeled. If that Japanese is shallow, he may get sucked to the surface in this sea state. I’d like to catch him if he does.” Pruitt pulled back on the control yoke. The big gray bird climbed slowly until the low cloud layer swallowed it up. The sea disappeared from view. There was a light gray wall outside, exactly the same color as the P-3C. Kevin Sheppard looked up from his screen and nodded. “I’m ready, Skipper. Taking the radar from ‘Standby’ to ‘ISAR search.’ Going to the two hundred-mile-range scale.” He flipped a couple of switches. The large CRT screen in front of him developed into a picture of the seas below. “Skipper, we’re radiating. Only return is that freighter and a lot of sea-return.” “Okay, keep your eyes peeled.” The crew sat back for the long wait. Hunting submarines was a game of strategy, guesswork, and waiting. Pruitt had once tried to explain the gratification of a successful sub hunt to his fighter-jock friends. He compared his game to one of chess, theirs to a kid’s video arcade game. He had given up when he realized the jet pilots lived in a split-second world of instant gratification while his was a slower paced one, a snail-paced… ([Location 5229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=5229))
- The Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar was designed to take detailed radar pictures of Soviet warships and do it while the P-3 was flying outside the warship’s anti-aircraft missile range. It used radar imaging. It worked just as well at night or through clouds as it did on a bright, sunny day. The pictures were so good that details as small as a foot long could be seen. Papa-Victor-Four could snap a few pictures of the Helena K without anyone on the rogue freighter even knowing there was a plane flying above her through the soupy, thick cloudbank.

- Ward looked around the control room. Ralston was head down in his trashcan. He was sharing it with Seaman Cortez. Master Chief Mendoza strapped himself in the diving officer’s chair and was using every trick he knew to keep Spadefish at periscope depth and to keep the churning seas from sucking her to the surface. The helmsman and planesman were pushing and pulling their control yokes as the sub rose and fell inside the waves. The quartermaster and the fire control technician were sharing their own trashcan over behind the plot table. The ventilation fans had the air moving just enough to keep the stench at a barely tolerable level. ([Location 5323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=5323))
- “Roger, Spadefish. We’ll ask,” he answered. “It may take a little time. We’ll drop an SUS when we have an answer, then again before we go off station.” An SUS, or Sound Underwater Signal, was a small bomb-shaped device the P-3 could drop into the ocean near the sub. Once in the water, it sent out a loud, coded, acoustic signal that a sub could hear on its sonar from a distance of several miles.

- The computer ground away, digesting innumerable bits of mundane data for the government bureaucracy. Hidden deep in the microchips of its inner workings, the machine was crunching away on another task. One infinitely more important and dangerous. What was it that pimply-faced gringo computer technician had called it? “Working in background.” If the kid had known what task Silveras’ computer was accomplishing “in background!” While he moved boring government files around, the machine was searching cyberspace for specific and vital information required by El Jefe. It was churning, electronically sifting through file drawers, rifling through bank records, reviewing shipping manifests, doing all the work and taking all the risks that Silveras once had to face in person. An icon popped up on his screen with a faint “ding” sound. To anyone watching, the innocuous little lightning bolt wouldn’t mean anything, and, unless they knew the special keystrokes, no one would ever be able to find out. Old habits die hard. Silveras looked around his cramped little office to make sure before he touched the keys. No one was anywhere around. He was all alone. With a few keystrokes and a quickly entered password, he was looking at a long list of files that contained any of the search words El Jefe had requested. ([Location 5351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=5351))
- So, Senor Holbrooke was planning a little trip to Europe. That was something El Jefe would be interested in. It looked as if the banker was moving money…a great deal of money…from his personal bank accounts. Very interesting indeed. Silveras read through the files carefully, looking for anything else that might jump out at him, all the while committing every detail to memory. Once he was certain he would forget nothing, that he had gleaned all he needed from the documents, he closed the special program, stepped out of his office into the narrow hallway and locked the door behind him. He had developed quite an appetite. It was time for an early lunch and a special phone call. ([Location 5360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=5360))
- "Snap shot, sierra nine-two, tube one!” Ward shouted. “Set surface settings, high speed, Doppler enable in." What he was about to do was a calculated risk. The two ships were only a hundred yards apart. The torpedo could easily hit the wrong one. The weapon was set to go for the moving target; the one whose sonar return showed a Doppler shift. It was a risk Ward had to take. The pleading voice on the radio would have convinced him to go ahead even if nothing else had. Stan Guhl's fingers danced across the torpedo-firing panel as he talked to Chief Ralston down in the torpedo room. To Ward, watching the scene unfold above, it seemed to take forever. Twenty seconds passed. Guhl shouted, "Ready, snapshot tube one." ([Location 6488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07MY8RF25&location=6488))
- The hatch opened on the main deck a few feet aft of the sail and ten sailors poured out. Four stood watching the water with their M-16s at the ready. The rest pushed equipment up the hatch and laid it out. The last man up the hatch was Joe Glass. Ward shouted down to him.
