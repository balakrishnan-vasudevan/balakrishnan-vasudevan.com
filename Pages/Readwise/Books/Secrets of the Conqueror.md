## Highlights
- An individual sound signature of a surface ship or submarine consists essentially of three elements: there is the continuous noise coming from her internal machinery, there are the specific sound frequencies coming from her propulsion systems, and then the low-frequency sound caused by the vibration from her propeller. Taken together they can locate a ship or submarine accurately and may even enable a skilled sonar operator to identify an individual vessel.

- The primary source of propeller noise was ‘cavitation’ which was caused by air bubbles forming and collapsing near the propeller blades, this often being the result of a blade that had damage or excessive wear. The degree of cavitation could also indicate other things – cavitation from the blades of a dived submarine would tend to be higher-pitched than the cavitation from a submarine on the surface; even the cavitation from an oil tanker that was fully laden and thus had a deeper draft, would be different to the sound of the cavitation when the vessel was unladen.
