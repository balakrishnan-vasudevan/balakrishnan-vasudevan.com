## Highlights
- In retrospect, it would seem an odd way to start a war. Only one of the participants knew what was really happening, and even that was a coincidence. The property settlement had been moved up on the calendar due to a death in the attorney’s family, and so the attorney was scheduled for a redeye flight, two hours from now, to Hawaii.

- There was a university somewhere in the Midwest, Jack had once heard on the radio, which had an instrument package designed to go inside a tornado. Each spring, graduate students and a professor or two staked out a likely swath of land, and on spotting a tornado, tried to set the instrument package, called “Toto”—what else?—directly in the path of the onrushing storm. So far they had been unsuccessful. Perhaps they’d just picked the wrong place, Ryan thought, looking out the window to the leafless trees in Lafayette Park. The office of the President’s National Security Advisor was surely cyclonic enough for anyone’s taste, and, unfortunately, much easier for people to enter. “You know,” Ryan said, leaning back in his chair, “it was supposed to be a lot simpler than this.” And I thought it would be, he didn’t add. “The world had rules before,” Scott Adler pointed out. “Now it doesn’t.” “How’s the President been doing, Scott?” ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QEAQPS&location=339))

- Laval’s eyes focused on the waterfall display. He settled more squarely into his chair and reached for a grease pencil, tapping the third-class next to him. “Two-seven-zero,” he said quietly. “Yeah.” “What you got, Junior?” the CO asked. “Just a sniff, sir, on the sixty-hertz line.” Thirty seconds later: “Firming up.” Kennedy stood behind the two watch-standers. There were now two dotted lines, one in the sixty-hertz frequency portion of the display, another on a higher-frequency band. The electric motors on the Japanese Harushio-class submarine used sixty-cycle A/C electrical current. An irregular series of dots, yellow on the dark screen, started cascading down in a column under the “60” frequency heading like droplets falling in slow motion from a leaky faucet, hence the appellation ”waterfall display.“ Junior Laval let it grow for a few more seconds to see if it might be random and decided that it was probably not. “Sir, I think we might want to start a track now. Designate this contact Sierra-One, possible submerged contact, bearing settling down on two-seven-four, strength is weak.” Kennedy relayed the information to the fire-control tracking party fifteen feet away. Another technician activated the ray-path analyzer, a high-end Hewlett-Packard minicomputer programmed to examine the possible paths through the water that the identified acoustical signal might have followed.

- widely known to exist, the high-speed software for this piece of kit was still one of the Navy’s most closely held secrets, a product, Kennedy remembered, of Sonosystems, a Groton-based company run by one of Frenchy Laval’s top protégés. The computer chewed on the input data for perhaps a thousand microseconds and displayed its reply. “Sir, it’s direct path. My initial range estimate is between eight and twelve thousand yards.” “Set it up,” the approach officer told the petty officer on the fire-control director. “This one ain’t no humpback,” Laval reported three minutes later. “I have three lines on the guy now, classify Sierra-One as a definite submarine contact, operating on his electric motors.” Junior told himself that Laval père had made his rep stalking HEN-class Russian subs, which were about as hard to track as an earthquake. He adjusted his headphones. “Bearing steady at two-seven-four, getting hints of a blade rate on the guy.” “Solution light,” the lead fire-controlman reported. “I have a valid solution for tube three on target Sierra-One.” “Left ten-degrees rudder, come to new course one-eight-zero,” Kennedy ordered next to get a crossbearing, from which would come a better range-gate on the target, and also data on the sub’s course and speed. “Let’s slow her down, turns for five knots.” The stalk was always the fun part.

- Tennessee was at full speed now, diving deeper to eight hundred feet. The increased water pressure eliminated the chance of cavitation coming off her sophisticated screw system. Her natural-circulation reactor plant gave off no pump noise. Her smooth lines created no flow noise at all. Inside, crewmen wore rubber-soled shoes. Turbines were mounted on decks connected to the hull via springs to isolate and decouple propulsion sounds. Designed to radiate no noise at all, and universally referred to even by the fast-attack community as “black holes,” the class really was the quietest thing man had ever put to sea. Big, with nowhere near the speed and maneuverability of the smaller attack boats, Tennessee and her sisters were still ahead in the most important category of performance. Even whales had a hard time hearing one. ([Location 11873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QEAQPS&location=11873))
