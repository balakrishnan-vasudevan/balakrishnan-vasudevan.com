## Highlights
- Murphy is right. • Never go against your gut. • Always listen to your gut; it is your operational antenna. • Everyone is potentially under opposition control. • Don’t look back; you are never completely alone. Use your gut. • Go with the flow; use the terrain. • Take the natural break of traffic. • Maintain a natural pace. • Establish a distinctive and dynamic profile and pattern. • Stay consistent over time. • Vary your pattern, and stay within your profile. • Be nonthreatening; keep them relaxed. Mesmerize! • Lull them into a sense of complacency. • Know the opposition and their terrain intimately. • Build in opportunity, but use it sparingly. • Don’t harass the opposition. • Make sure they can anticipate your destination. • Pick the time and the place for action. • Any operation can be aborted; if it feels wrong, then it is wrong. • Keep your options open. • If your gut says to act, overwhelm their senses. • Use misdirection, illusion, and deception. • Hide small operative motions in larger nonthreatening motions. • Float like a butterfly; sting like a bee. • When free, in obscura (IO), immediately change direction and leave the area. • Break your trail, and blend into the local scene. • Execute a surveillance-detection run designed to draw them out over time. • Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, but three times is an enemy action. • Avoid static lookouts; stay away from choke points where they can reacquire you. • Select an IO or meeting site so you can overlook the scene. • Keep any asset separated from you by time and distance until it is time. • If the asset has surveillance, then the operation has gone bad. • Only approach the site when you are sure it is clean. • After the IO meeting or act is done, close the loop at a logical cover destination. • Be aware of surveillance’s time tolerance so they aren’t forced to raise an alert. • If an alert is issued, they must pay a price, and so must you. • Let them believe they lost you; act innocent. • There is no limit to a human being’s ability to rationalize the truth. • Technology will always let you down. • Never fall in love with your agent. • Betrayal may come from within.
