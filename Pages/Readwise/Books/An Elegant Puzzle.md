## Highlights
- organizational design is the attempt to understand why some create such energy and others create mostly heat: friction, frustration, and politics. I believe that excellent organizations grow from consistently applying a straightforward process. ([Location 202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=202))
- When I have a problem that I want to solve quickly and cheaply, I start thinking about process design. A problem I want to solve permanently and we have time to go slow? That’s a good time to evolve your culture. However, if process is too weak a force, and culture too slow, then organizational design lives between those two.

- Teams should be six to eight during steady state. To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten, and then bud into two teams of four or five. Never create empty teams. Never leave managers supporting more than eight individuals. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=258))

- A team is falling behind if each week their backlog is longer than it was the week before. Typically, people are working extremely hard but not making much progress, morale is low, and your users are vocally dissatisfied.

- A team is treading water if they’re able to get their critical work done, but are not able to start paying down technical debt or begin major new projects. Morale is a bit higher, but people are still working hard, and your users may seem happier because they’ve learned that asking for help won’t go anywhere. A team is repaying debt when they’re able to start paying down technical debt, and are beginning to benefit from the debt repayment snowball: each piece of debt you repay leads to more time to repay more debt. A team is innovating when their technical debt is sustainably low, morale is high, and the majority of work is satisfying new user needs.

- Adding new individuals to a team disrupts that team’s gelling process, so I’ve found it much easier to have rapid growth periods for any given team, followed by consolidation/gelling periods during which the team gels.

- The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt10 and Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donella H. Meadows11 are both phenomenal books on this topic. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QYCHJ7V&location=373))
