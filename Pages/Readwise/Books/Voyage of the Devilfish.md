## Highlights
- “We spend a lot of time trailing their boats. We can get away with that because we’re quieter than they are; it’s harder for them to hear us. And every sub has a blind spot astern of it. We call it the baffles. The screw and engines block out the ocean noises to the rear of the ship, and most sonar gear is located in the nosecone of the sub. So if you’re good, you can sneak up on another sub and just follow him in the cone of silence behind the screw. That boat there,” Donchez said, pointing to the blue X in the Barents Sea, “is driven by my old Annapolis roommate. He’s in trail of a new Russian boat called the AKULA. Whenever they launch a new one we try to trail them on their sea trials and see how the new boat does, spy on their exercise torpedo shots, observe their tactics. Since an attack submarine is invisible it can do things no one will ever know about. Anyway, that’s the idea.” ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=160))
- “It looks like Target One still doesn’t know we’re here. Let’s hope he won’t until it’s too late. I intend to fire two torpedoes in a horizontal salvo. Be ready to evade if Target One fires back and be alert in case he runs from the torpedoes. If Target One zigs we’ll do a quick maneuver to get his new solution and turn the weapons … Firing-point procedures—tube one Target One, tube two Target One, horizontal salvo, thirty-second firing interval, ten-degree offset.” ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=239))
- “Unit one, you are in tube one. The mother ship is on course 180, depth 546 feet. When you’re launched, turn to course 240 at 45 knots and dive to 800 feet depth. Arm the warhead when you are 6000 yards away from mother ship, your run-to-enable. Then start your 25-knot active sonar search at depth 300 feet. The enemy sub, Target One, is currently at bearing 225, and will drive into your search cone at a range of 2000 yards. When you get three confirmed return pings in a row, accelerate to your 50-knot terminal run. When you detect the iron of the enemy hull, detonate your explosives. If you turn more than 180 degrees, you may start homing in on the mother ship. If that happens, shut down your engine, flood and sink. If the target zigs we will turn you toward him with further instructions using your guidance wire.” With each downloaded instruction the Hullbuster torpedoes acknowledged. Two faithful golden retrievers, wagging their tails and panting near the master’s hand, waited for the command to go.

- The Officer of the Deck, Lieutenant Scott Brayton, reported, “Ship ready.” The Weapons Officer, Lieutenant Commander Steve Bahnhoff, called out, “Weapons ready.” “Solution ready,” said Commander Jon Rapier, the Executive Officer. Pacino opened his mouth to speak as Lieutenant Stokes, the officer on the central firecontrol panel, said, “Possible zig, Target One.” “Zig confirmed,” Rapier said. “Time-frequency plot. Possible maneuver to starboard—” ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=260))
- Stokes sat at the central firecontrol console, Position Two, and stared intently at the screen as if willing his dot-stack of sonar data to line up. But the sonar sensor was passive—it only listened and gave the bearing or direction of the enemy sub, not its range, course or speed. At the base of the screen were knobs that could dial in trial enemy ranges, speeds and courses—the combination of range/course/speed of the enemy submarine making up the “solution.” It was found by driving the Devilfish back and forth and seeing the effect on the bearing to the target. With the computer to help, Lieutenant Stokes could dial in any number of guess-solutions, but he started from a reasonable one and refined until the bearing dot-stack was vertical. It all worked fine when the target stayed on course. When he zigged, only an expert like Stokes could reach out with his intuition and capture the target’s motion. Finally the dot-stack was vertical and Stokes announced his arrival at a solution: “XO, I have a solution.” ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=275))
- “Time-bearing, what’s the status?” the XO said. “XO, gotta curve, bearing-rate right, range ten thousand yards,” Ensign Fasteen reported from a manual-plot board. The XO immediately reported it to Pacino: “Captain, we have a curve and a firing solution.” “Firing-point procedures,” Pacino announced again, “horizontal salvo, first fired unit, tube one.” He paused a moment, then said, “C’mon, guys, let’s get these fish out. Target One may detect us at any moment and zig again. Okay, first fired unit, shoot on generated bearing,” Pacino ordered, starting to feel intensely alive. This was the point of no return. “Set,” Stokes said, sending the final solution to the firing panel and to the weapon in tube one. “Stand by.” Bahnhoff, on the firing panel, taking his trigger lever all the way to the left, the STANDBY position. “Shoot!” Pacino commanded. “Fire,” Bahnhoff said, taking the trigger level all the way to the right, to the FIRE position. The whole ship jumped and a booming roar slammed the eardrums of all twenty-one men in the control room. Pacino’s white teeth, upper and lower, were all visible. This was a sweet sound, the crash of a torpedo-launch. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=283))
- “Maneuvering answers ahead standard. Steady course north, sir.” ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=310))

- For the next thirty seconds Pacino sweated. Two sonar bearings came in and lined up vertically. His solution was dead on. He punched Stokes’ massive shoulder and pointed to the computer console. Stokes just shook his head. “Weps, steer the first fired unit to course one seven five,” Pacino said to Weapons Officer Bahnhoff on the firing panel. “Steer the second to one eight zero.” He looked over Bahnhoff’s shoulder as he programmed the firing panel with the steer commands; the firing panel talked digitally to the torpedo room console, which relayed the instructions to the tubes, which passed on the steer commands through a neutrally buoyant wire the size of a stereo speaker cord, snaking out the tube to the ocean beyond through twenty miles of wire to the units. The units heard the order and turned to the south, listening to their pings. One unit got a ping return in its search cone almost immediately. “Detect,” Bahnhoff announced, smiling at Pacino. “Unit one, detect. Homing, unit one. Go, baby, go.” The first fired unit had heard three returns in a row, deciding that Target One was a valid target. The torpedo sped up to 50 knots, its attack speed. The faces of the control room crew lit up in anticipation. “Unit two, detect,” Bahnhoff said happily. “Detect. Lost it, come on, sweetheart. Detect. Acquisition, unit two. Captain, we’ve got him.” “Conn, Sonar,” Pacino heard through his headset, the volume suddenly loud. “Torpedo in the water, bearing two three five!” Target One had finally returned fire. “Helm,” Pacino ordered, “all ahead flank. Maneuvering cavitate. Diving Officer, depth fifteen hundred feet, thirty-five degree down angle.” ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=316))
- Four ominous booms shook the ship as its main reactor coolant pumps were switched to fast speed. Aside from a torpedo-launch, the check valves in the coolant piping made the loudest noise the Devilfish could make. The deck began to vibrate as the ship came up to flank speed, 35 knots, her dual main engines shrieking far aft in the engine room, her screw spinning wildly and cavitating—boiling up sheets of angry, noisy bubbles of steam in the ocean.

- The control team consisted of three men seated at controls, two in front on either side of a central console and one in the middle to supervise the other two. In the port seat was the sternplanesman, who put his control yoke to full dive. Two hundred feet aft the huge control surfaces, driven by high pressure hydraulics, went to the dive position, forcing the submarine to a down angle. Her speed, and the fairwater planes in a diving position on the sail, nosed her down into a steep 35-degree dive. Every man at battlestations held on to keep from falling to the forward bulkhead. The hull of the submarine groaned and popped as seawater pressure increased with the depth. No matter how many years a man spent at sea, submerged, the sound would always be eerie, ominous, Pacino thought.

- “incoming torpedo now bears two three three. Slight right bearing drift. It’s range gating.” ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01M7T6ZYZ&location=342))
- In the Devilfish’s main ballast tanks, filled a moment before with seawater, high-pressure air forced the seawater out. The tanks went dry fifteen seconds after the aft-system blow, and suddenly Devilfish was hundreds of tons lighter. Nothing would keep her submerged for long now.

- For a moment the two men watched a huge crane below move a periscope into position for lowering into the teardrop-shaped conning tower. The black hull was oval in cross-section, making it seem fat. The tail section had a teardrop-shaped pod mounted horizontally on the vertical tail fin. The screw was shrouded in a cylindrical cover. Up forward two hatches were open and men and supplies were passing in and out from the gangway to the drydock rim.
