## Highlights
- Once people stop making excuses, stop blaming others, and take ownership of everything in their lives, they are compelled to take action to solve their problems. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=44))
- “Relax. Look around. Make a call.” ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=241))

- The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=299))
- Despite all the failures of individuals, units, and leaders, and despite the myriad mistakes that had been made, there was only one person to blame for everything that had gone wrong on the operation: me. I hadn’t been with our sniper team when they engaged the Iraqi soldier. I hadn’t been controlling the rogue element of Iraqis that entered the compound. But that didn’t matter. As the SEAL task unit commander, the senior leader on the ground in charge of the mission, I was responsible for everything in Task Unit Bruiser. I had to take complete ownership of what went wrong. That is what a leader does—even if it means getting fired. If anyone was to be blamed and fired for what happened, let it be me.

- On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win. ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=589))
- If an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must train and mentor that underperformer. But if the underperformer continually fails to meet standards, then a leader who exercises Extreme Ownership must be loyal to the team and the mission above any individual. If underperformers cannot improve, the leader must make the tough call to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done. It is all on the leader.

- there are no bad teams, only bad leaders. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=856))
- The answer: leadership is the single greatest factor in any team’s performance. Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader. The leader’s attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance—or doesn’t. And this applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to the junior leaders of teams within the team. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=858))
- I discovered that it was far more effective to focus their efforts not on the days to come or the far-distant finish line they couldn’t yet see, but instead on a physical goal immediately in front of them—the beach marker, landmark, or road sign a hundred yards ahead. If we could execute with a monumental effort just to reach an immediate goal that everyone could see, we could then continue to the next visually attainable goal and then the next. When pieced together, it meant our performance over time increased substantially and eventually we crossed the finish line at the head of the pack.

- Leaders must accept total responsibility, own problems that inhibit performance, and develop solutions to those problems. A team could only deliver exceptional performance if a leader ensured the team worked together toward a focused goal and enforced high standards of performance, working to continuously improve. With a culture of Extreme Ownership within the team, every member of the team could contribute to this effort and ensure the highest levels of performance. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=877))
- when it comes to standards, as a leader, it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate. ([Location 936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0739PYQSS&location=936))
- Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mind-set into the team. They must face the facts through a realistic, brutally honest assessment of themselves and their team’s performance. Identifying weaknesses, good leaders seek to strengthen them and come up with a plan to overcome challenges. The best teams anywhere, like the SEAL Teams, are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher.
