- pouring tea from a small Kiyomizu-ware teapot. Meanwhile, Nagare brought out Hideji’s food on a tray. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=74))

- ‘Stewed arame and deep-fried tofu. Okara croquettes. Kikuna leaves dressed with sesame and miso. Kurama-style sardine. Hirosu tofu ball in broth. Pork belly simmered in Kyobancha tea. Fresh tofu curd with sour plum paste. Oh, and Koishi’s rice-bran-pickled cucumbers. Nothing too extravagant. If anything, the highlights are probably the firmly cooked Goshu rice and the miso soup with ebi-imo taro. Anyway, enjoy the meal. Oh, and make sure you put a good sprinkle of sansho pepper on the soup – it’ll warm you right up.’ ([Location 80](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=80))

- ‘Tuck in while it’s hot!’ urged Koishi. Hideji sprinkled the sansho pepper and picked up the bowl of miso soup. ([Location 84](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=84))

- ‘How about steeping your rice in tea? You could mix it with some of the sardine. Koishi, why don’t you pour him some hojicha?’ Taking her cue, Koishi poured the hot tea from a Banko teapot. ‘So you call it Kurama-style in Kyoto. Where I’m from, if you simmer something with sansho pepper, that’s Arima-style.’ ‘Must be a case of local pride then. Kurama and Arima are both famous for their sansho, aren’t they?’ ‘You learn something new every day!’ said Koishi.

- ‘Nabeyaki-udon. You know, vegetables and chicken simmered with udon noodles.’ ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=173))

- Then she placed a Karatsu-ware bowl in the middle of the table, with a celadon-green spoon on the right. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=290))
- ‘All of it. Scatter it all over, then give the soup a good mix with the ladle. Then whack the heat up. Simmer everything for a bit, crack the egg in, then turn the heat off and pop the lid on right away. Not tightly, though – leave it a little askew,’ instructed Nagare. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=321))

- ‘Well, things can taste very different depending on how you’re feeling,’ ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=342))

- ‘First, I investigated the soup stock – or rather, where Chieko bought the ingredients for it. That was my starting point. I paid a visit to the Junenji temple area and talked to your neighbours. Seems you don’t talk to them much, but Chieko certainly did. One woman in particular remembered her very well. Apparently they even used to go shopping together, at the Masugata arcade over in Demachi.’ Nagare spread out a map and pointed to the area in question with a pen. ‘Oh, yes. With that famous sweet shop where people line up all day for the mame-mochi,’ said Hideji, glancing at the map with his chopsticks still in hand. ‘Yes – that’s Demachi Futaba. And just next to it is the Masugata shopping arcade. The locals don’t shop at touristy places like Nishiki Market – they all go to Masugata. Seems that’s where Chieko got most of her ingredients. Kombu and bonito flakes for the soup stock from Fujiya, chicken from Torisen, vegetables from Kaneko . . . She always got her ingredients from the same places. The other housewives in the area still do all their shopping there too.’ Nagare showed Hideji a pamphlet for the shopping arcade. ‘Does it really make that much of a difference where you buy the ingredients?’ asked Hideji, relishing a mouthful of chicken. ‘Oh yes. The individual differences might be small, but the combined effect in the dish can be pretty noticeable. For example, when she bought ingredients for her stock from Fujiya, she made sure it was top-grade Matsumae kombu, and combined that with Soda bonito flakes and dried mackerel flakes. Then, when she was making up the stock at home, she’d add Urume sardines to the mix. Chieko told your neighbour all about it, apparently.’ ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=349))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- ‘It’s not just the dashi stock. See that shiitake you’ve got there? Chieko would take a batch of them, dry them out in the sun, rehydrate them, and then boil them down with soy and sugar. That way, when you bite into them, you get that wonderful burst of umami.’ ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=365))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- ‘Still, Chieko didn’t have time to make udon by hand, or fry the tempura herself. You were too impatient for that. Instead she bought fresh noodles and prawn tempura from a little shop named Hanasuzu. Tastes just like it used to, doesn’t it? The shop’s owner told me they haven’t changed their noodle batter or the way they fry the tempura one bit in all these years.’ ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=368))

- ‘She’d put the kombu in the earthenware pot, together with a layer of roughly chopped Kujo negi, then pour in the stock. Once you were sitting down at the table, she’d turn on the stove. When the pot came to the boil she’d add the chicken, and once that was cooked she’d loosen up the udon noodles and add them. Next, she’d add the kamaboko slices, dried wheat cake, shiitake and prawn tempura. Then, right at the end, she’d crack the egg in,’ explained Nagare. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=373))

- ‘See how it’s partitioned into four? In the top right is a selection of smaller appetizers. In the bottom right is the grilled fish of the day – in this case, teriyaki yellowtail. Top left is a selection of sashimi and pickled dishes: Akashi sea bream, Kishu tuna, and flash-grilled Karatsu abalone. Seared Miyajima conger eel, served with pickled cucumber and myoga ginger. And in the bottom left is the matsutake rice – the mushrooms are from Shinshu, and wonderfully fragrant. I’ll bring some soup over shortly. In the meantime, enjoy!’ ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=491))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- ‘The sashimi looks wonderful, but these appetizers are simply exquisite. Let’s see . . . rolled barracuda sushi, dashi-maki omelette, and those look like quail tsukune balls. And this simmered octopus – it just melts on your tongue!’ Tae’s mouth was agape with delight. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=498))

- ‘I don’t think I’ve had a bento this nice since those Tsujitomi ones we had at the tea ceremony. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=500))

- ‘And what have we here?’ asked Tae, removing the lid from the Negoro lacquerware bowl. ‘Tilefish and crab meat broth. It’s chilly these days, so I grated some kudzu in to thicken it up – you know, make it a little more warming. Please, enjoy while it’s hot,’ replied Nagare, tucking his tray under his arm. ‘The yuzu has a wonderful aroma too,’ said Nobuko, bringing the bowl close to her nose. ‘That’s from a village called Mizuo in the mountains west of Kyoto. Fragrant, isn’t it? Well, I’ll leave you to it.’ ‘This grated kudzu really adds something,’ said Tae to Koishi, cupping the bowl in her hands. ‘Piping hot – and delicious.’ ‘Nice subtle flavour, isn’t it?’ replied Koishi, practically drooling as she watched. ‘We make a hotpot version of it sometimes. Put lightly seared tilefish and crab in the bottom of the pot, then add some dashi stock and plenty of grated turnip. Season it with some shichimi spice and yuzu, and it’ll warm you right through.’ ‘I suppose we should eat up!’ said Tae to Nobuko, as if to bring the conversation to a close. ‘There’s also dessert – sorry, I mean the mizugashi course. So please take your time,’ said Koishi, shrugging her shoulders. ‘That’s right, Koishi. There’s no such thing as “dessert” in Japanese cuisine. The fruit served at the end of the meal is called mizugashi. We’re not in France, after all!’ said Tae, her nostrils flaring. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=508))

- ‘No, it does matter. If you mess around with language like that, it’s culture that suffers. Traditional Japanese sweet dishes are in decline precisely because people insist on calling them English words like “dessert”!’ ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=522))

- ‘Oh – is that a Daishiro persimmon?’ asked Tae. ‘I thought they were finished for the year.’ ‘Dai-shir-o?’ repeated Nobuko, spoon in hand. ‘I suppose you don’t get them much up in Tokyo,’ said Tae, inserting her spoon into the fruit. ‘And this Baccarat plate! The persimmon is so vivid against the crystal.’ ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=533))

- ‘A famous food writer once said the beef stew at Furuta Grill tastes almost like pot-au-feu, but I actually think it’s a little different. I imagine they were referring to that delicateness you just mentioned, which comes from using a light tomato-based demi-glace rather than the usual thicker kind. The meat is precooked in stock and quickly simmered with port wine. Put it in a pot with the vegetables, add the demi-glace and cook everything down, and this is the result. If you just chuck the vegetables in with the beef from the start, they lose their shape and all the flavours get confused. But do it Furuta-style and the sauce will simply coat the meat. That way, the umami from the beef and the flavour of the demi-glace only come together once they’re in your mouth.’ ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=771))
- Fried tofu and mizuna leaves braised in soy sauce. Simmered herring and aubergine. Lightly pickled turnip. Seasoned egg scrambled with sardine fry. Vinegared mackerel. Taro stem dressed with ground sesame. The miso-glazed fish was probably pomfret, and the steam rising from it indicated that it had just been grilled. Miso soup with onions and potatoes. Tomomi pressed his palms together in a quick gesture of appreciation then, holding the Kiyomizu-ware rice bowl in his left hand, reached for his chopsticks. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=902))
- The moment Tomomi tasted the dish, he involuntarily closed his eyes. That sweetness of the egg, mingling with the slight bitterness of the tiny sardines. The nutty aroma of the sesame oil . . . it was all just like back in the day. Tomomi leaned forward and, in a slight breach of etiquette, hovered his chopsticks back and forth over the various dishes, contemplating what to eat next. Eventually he opted for the herring. It broke apart effortlessly between his chopsticks, and was quite strongly flavoured – just the way he liked it. After cleansing his palate with a slice of pickled turnip, he picked up the bowl of miso soup. Ever since childhood, Tomomi had believed that potatoes and onions were the best ingredients for miso soup. The amount of miso was just right too. Working his way through the dishes, he emptied his bowl of rice in no time at all. Koishi noticed, and chuckled. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=908))
- ‘You’re still young, aren’t you? All you care about is eating the tastiest food you can. Get to my age and you’ll realize that nostalgia can be just as vital an ingredient. I want to eat the mackerel sushi that made me so happy back then, that’s all. Oh, and by the way,’ he added with a wry smile, ‘it’s Yamada, not Yamamoto.’ ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1017))
- ‘In Tosa, there’s a type of sushi called inaka-zushi, where they use the local yuzu fruit to season the rice. They combine it with the usual vinegar, giving the rice a yellow colour. It has quite the unique aroma. Not sure I’d call it lemony, though.’ ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1144))
- ‘From top left,’ began Nagare, tucking the tray under his arm, ‘Miyajima oysters, simmered Kurama-style, miso-glazed baked butterburs with millet cake, bracken and bamboo shoot stew, chargrilled moroko, breast of Kyoto-reared chicken with a wasabi dressing, and vinegared Wakasa mackerel wrapped in pickled Shogoin turnip. In the bottom right you have a hamaguri clam broth thickened with kudzu starch. Tonight’s customer asked me to create something that evoked both the lingering winter and the onset of spring, which led to the dishes you see here. Today’s rice is of the Koshihikari variety, sourced from Tamba. Please – enjoy the meal.’ ([Location 1279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1279))
- Two of the small fish were arranged on an oval Kiseto-ware plate. ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1287))
- Next she turned to the bowl of clam broth. She removed the lid, with its maki-e design depicting a budding willow tree, and was greeted by a cloud of steam heavy with the fragrance of the clams and their yuzu garnish. Suyako took a sip of the broth, then let out a deep sigh. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1294))
- ‘At Katsuden they always served three types of sauce with the meal. From right to left: sweet, spicy, and ponzu. They’d serve six bite-size pieces of tonkatsu, so most customers would dip two in each sauce. I’ll tell you more about the recipe for those sauces in a moment.’ ([Location 1505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1505))
- ‘Eat this while it’s hot!’ said Koishi, placing a round Tachikui-ware plate in front of Suyako. ‘It’s a little early for dinner, so we haven’t served any rice on the side.’ ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1508))
- ‘The sauces are quite subtle too, don’t you think? As his wife, you must have guessed the secret ingredient right away.’ ‘Bitter orange?’ asked Suyako, looking up. ‘That’s right. Seems he used Yamaguchi oranges. Boiled them into a jam for the sweet sauce, mixed the rind with red chilli pepper for the spicy one, and squeezed their juice into the ponzu.’ ‘Never forgot those Yamaguchi flavours, did he?’ chipped in Koishi, who was standing at their side. ‘This ponzu sauce is like the type you get with fugu sashimi, but it goes well with tonkatsu too!’ said Suyako, dipping her little finger in the ponzu and licking it. ‘There’s a tiny bit of garlic in there,’ explained Nagare with a smile. ‘You know how fugu sashimi is served with negi onion? I think it’s a similar idea.’ ([Location 1520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1520))
- ‘As you’ll have noticed, the tonkatsu at Katsuden had a distinctive batter. It’s so soft that you might imagine Denjiro used fresh breadcrumbs rather than the usual dried ones, but then they still have quite a crunch. It turns out he actually sourced his breadcrumbs specially from a local bakery.’ Nagare placed a tray full of breadcrumbs on the table. Suyako wordlessly set her plate down, then tested the texture of the breadcrumbs with a finger. ‘The bakery was called Ryujitsudo, not far from Katsuden. He’d place custom orders with them. I went to see the owner and asked him about the tonkatsu at Katsuden.’ Nagare paused to take a sip of his tea. ‘Soft, but also quite fine-grained. Like I said, almost like fresh breadcrumbs, but slightly drier.’ ([Location 1532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1532))
- The frying oil was probably a mix of untoasted white sesame and Dutch salad oil.’ ([Location 1546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1546))
- ‘Eel and gyoza. I can’t get enough of either,’ said Koishi, placing a crescent-shaped lacquer tray in front of Asuka, together with a pair of Rikyu chopsticks. ([Location 1634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1634))
- ‘Starting from the top left: thinly sliced Akashi sea bream sashimi, with a prickly ash bud and miso dressing – to be enjoyed with the ponzu dipping sauce. Miso-glazed Kamo aubergine. Maizuru cockles sandwiched between slices of myoga ginger. Gizzard shad marinated in sweet vinegar, served in a miniature sushi roll. Fried matsutake, conger eel grilled two ways, Manganji sweet pepper tempura, abalone pickled in Kyoto-style sweet white miso and then grilled. Fish paste noodles, Kurama-style local chicken, smoked mackerel with a pine nut stuffing. Fresh soy milk curd and vegetables pickled with red perilla. Everything’s bite-sized, so it should be nice and easy to eat. I’ll bring you some eel-topped rice once that’s finished cooking. Please, enjoy the meal!’ ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1645))
- ‘Freshwater eel is tasty enough, but there’s something about the lightness of saltwater anago. The rice is topped with grilled anago from Akashi, with a garnish of green peppercorns.’ Nagare removed the lid from the pot, unleashing a thick column of steam. ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1658))
- I’ll bring you some hot hojicha.’ Nagare cleared away the empty dishes, then replaced her teapot with a Banko-ware one, alongside which he positioned a fresh teacup. ([Location 1673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1673))
- On the sizzling griddle dish was a mound of spaghetti coated in a red tomato sauce. But the rest of the plate’s surface was covered by a layer of whisked egg, so that the other dominant colour was yellow. Three frankfurters, split down the middle, adorned the mound of spaghetti. Asuka joined her hands together, then hastily reached for her fork. ([Location 1811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1811))
- ‘Apparently lots of people like to make a deliberately long stopover in Nagoya, just so they can visit this restaurant. What they call “Italian” in Nagoya isn’t quite the same as the usual Napolitan. You pour some whisked egg onto a hot plate, then add the spaghetti on top. That yellow colour you remember must have been the egg. As for the red bottle that your grandfather took a photo of,’ said Nagare, swiping through the photos on the tablet, ‘that must have been this. A huge bottle of Tabasco. I couldn’t help snapping a photo of it myself.’ ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1847))
- Spring and autumn are when the biggest crowds descend on Kyoto. In particular, spring sees a rush of tourists all trying to enjoy the short-lived cherry blossom season, leaving some parts of the city literally swarming with people. ([Location 1906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1906))
- ‘Oh, I’m not asking for a cup of tea, silly. I mean matcha powder.’ ‘Ah, wanting to mix it with your tempura salt, are you?’ asked Nagare, emerging from the kitchen with a small porcelain bowl. ‘I knew you’d figure it out, Nagare,’ said Tae. ‘I should have brought you some earlier,’ said Nagare, setting the bowl of powdered matcha down alongside the black lacquer tray from which she was eating. ‘Now, this may just be my imagination, but today’s wild vegetable tempura seemed to lack that slight bitterness it should have.’ Tae mixed the matcha into the mound of salt by her dish, then pressed the koshiabura tempura into it and took a bite. ‘There really is no pleasing you sometimes, is there? It’s true: the vegetables are a bit lacking in bitterness and fragrance this time. Went and foraged for them myself, up in the Kuta mountains, but still . . .’ Nagare folded his arms and cocked his head to one side. ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1951))
- ‘Seeing as it’s cherry season, I’ve gone for an imitation of a lunchbox from a blossom-viewing picnic. On top of that folded kaishi paper is the wild vegetable tempura. Ostrich fern, mugwort, devil’s walking stick, koshiabura and smilax. There’s some matcha salt on the side, or you can try it with the regular dipping sauce. The sashimi is cherry bass and halfbeak. Try it with the ponzu. For the grilled fish dish, I’ve gone with masu salmon in a miso marinade, together with some simmered young bamboo. Firefly squid and wakame seaweed dressed with vinegared miso, overnight Omi beef, and deep-fried chicken wing-tips. In that wooden bowl is an Asari clam and bamboo shoot broth. There’s bamboo shoots in the rice too, but I can serve you some plain white rice if you’d prefer. There’s more of everything, so just let me know if you’d like seconds. Well, tuck in!’ ([Location 1970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1970))
- ‘Glad to hear it. Here – let me pour you some coarse green tea,’ said Nagare, swapping the Kyo-ware teapot for the Mashiko one. When you’ve had a sip of that, give me a shout and I’ll show you to the office.’ ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1996))
- ‘Of course. I hope you like it wrapped in cherry leaves. I suppose you’d like your matcha tea nice and strong, as usual?’ ‘Well, if it’s sakura-mochi you’re serving me, it might be best to brew it a little weaker than usual.’ ‘Let me guess – because the mochi isn’t actually that sweet?’ ‘Exactly.’ Once Nagare and Tae had finished their exchange, Hisahiko got to his feet, rubbing his stomach. ‘Thank you for the food. I can make my own way to the office – I can see you’re busy in here. Through that door on the left and straight down the corridor, is it? Akane told me all about it. I should be fine.’ ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=1998))
- ‘The meat is A5-grade Matsusaka beef, and the potatoes are Northern Rubies from Hokkaido. Both of the finest quality. The broth is flavoured with Shimousa soy sauce from Chiba and a type of high-grade refined Japanese sugar normally used to make desserts. Of course, my mother probably didn’t use ingredients quite like those. But Mr Tateno was so kind as to suggest that, given how I’ve turned out, the nikujaga I ate must have been of at least similar quality.’ ([Location 2170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=2170))
- The antique Imari-ware bowl was full to the brim with stew. Alongside it was a smaller bowl, decorated with lines traced in bright cobalt pigment and piled with white rice, a small Shigaraki dish bearing some pickled cabbage, and a Negoro lacquered wooden bowl from which rose an appetizing cloud of steam. ‘This is nikujaga the way your mother made it. Koshihikari rice from Hiroshima. Cooked so that it’s all soft and sticky. Apparently you liked it that way.’ ‘I did? But how did you . . .’ ‘Let’s talk about that when you’ve finished. On the side you have extra-pickled Hiroshimana cabbage. And the miso soup is with a sea bream broth and poached egg. All your favourites, I believe. Please, enjoy!’ ([Location 2179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C5V9H3J2&location=2179))
- ‘Kure, the district which the island of Toyoshima belongs to, is said to be the birthplace of nikujaga stew. Now, with Kure-style nikujaga you’d normally use May Queen potatoes, which don’t fall apart when you boil them, but your mother Kimie used a famous brand of potato from Akasaki, not far from the island. Dejima potatoes, they’re called – and still popular to this day. The onions were from Awajima, and the soy sauce from Shodoshima. This was almost thirty years ago, so sourcing ingredients of that quality would have been quite a challenge. You must really have been the apple of her eye.’ ‘But what about here, where it says “Yamato-ni”?’ asked Hisahiko, his eyes glued to the notebook. ‘Does that mean she used . . .’ ‘That’s right. Canned meat,’ said Nagare, placing a can on the table. ‘Yamato-ni – soy-stewed beef. Like it says in the notebook, in those days there was nowhere on the island that had a regular supply of high-quality beef. You weren’t a fan of meat with a lot of fat on it, which was why your mother used the canned stuff, which was reliably lean. And, seeing as she and your father ran a warehousing business, she probably had ways of getting her hands on it.
