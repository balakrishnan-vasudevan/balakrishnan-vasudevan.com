## Highlights
- IT’S BEEN OVER A DECADE SINCE THE FIRST WEBSITES REACHED REAL SCALE. We were there then, in those early days, watching our sites growing faster than anyone had seen before or knew how to manage. It was up to us figure out how to keep everything running, to make things happen, to get things done. While everyone else was at the launch party, we were deep in the bowels of the datacenter racking and stacking the last servers. Then we sat at our desks late into the night, our faces lit with the glow of logfiles and graphs streaming by. Our experiences were universal: Our software crashed or couldn’t scale. The databases crashed and data was corrupted, while every server, disk, and switch failed in ways the manufacturer absolutely, positively said it wouldn’t. Hackers attacked — first for fun and then for profit. And just when we got things working again, a new feature would be pushed out, traffic would spike, and everything would break all over again. In the early days, we used what we could find because we had no budget. Then we grew from mismatched, scavenged machines hidden in closets to megawatt-scale datacenters spanning the globe filled with the cheapest machines we could find. As we got to scale, we had to deal with the real world and its many dangers. Our datacenters caught fire, flooded, or were ripped apart by hurricanes. Our power failed. Generators didn’t kick in — or started and then ran out of fuel — or were taken down when someone hit the Emergency Power Off. Cooling failed. Sprinklers leaked. Fiber was cut by backhoes and squirrels and strange creatures crawling along the seafloor. Man, machine, and Mother Nature challenged us in every way imaginable and then surprised us in ways we never expected. We worked from the instant our pagers woke us up or when a friend innocently inquired, “is the site down?” or when the CEO called scared and furious. We were always the first ones to know it was down and the last to leave when it was back up again. Always. Every day we got a little smarter, a little wiser, and learned a few more tricks. The scripts we wrote a decade ago have matured into tools and languages of their own, and whole industries have emerged around what we do. The knowledge, experiences, tools, and processes are growing into an art we call Web Operations. We say that Web Operations is an art, not a science, for a reason. There are no standards, certifications, or formal schooling (at least not yet). What we do takes a long time to learn and longer to master, and everyone at every skill level must find his or her own style. There’s no “right way,” only what works (for now) and a commitment to doing it even better next time. The web is changing the way we live and touches every person alive. As more and more people depend on the web, they depend on us. Web Operations is work that matters. ([Location 19](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=19))

- Operations is all about understanding where theory and practice collide, and devising methodologies to limit the casualties from the explosions that ensue. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=182))
- The effort to master any given discipline requires four basic pursuits: knowledge, tools, experience, and discipline. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=211))
- If you are reading this, you already understand the value of knowledge through books. A healthy bookshelf is something all master web operations engineers have in common. ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=219))
- A great tool in any operations engineer’s tool chest is a system call tracer. They vary (slightly) from system to system. Solaris has truss, Linux has strace, FreeBSD has ktrace, and Mac OS X had ktrace but displaced that with the less useful dtruss. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=249))
- Experience is, in its very essence, making good judgments, and it is gained by making bad ones. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=272))
- Knowledge can be considered the studying of experiences of others. You have the information but have not grasped the deeper meaning that is gained by directly experiencing the causality. That deeper meaning allows you to apply the lesson learned in other situations where your experience-honed insight perceives correlations — an insight that often escapes those with knowledge alone. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=277))
- Experience is both a noun and a verb: gaining it is as easy (and as hard) as doing it. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=280))
- Although gaining experience is as easy as simply “doing,” in the case of web operations it is the process of making and surviving bad judgments. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=282))
- The first is to make it safe for junior and mid-level engineers to make bad judgments. You accomplish this by limiting liability and injury from individual judgments. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=286))
- The larger the mistake, the more profound the opportunity to extract deep and lasting value from the lesson. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=289))
- Never allow the same bad judgment twice. Mistakes happen. Bad judgments will occur as a matter of fact. Not learning from one’s mistakes is inexcusable. Although exceptions always exist, you should expect and promote a culture of zero tolerance for repetitious bad judgment. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=290))
- The single biggest characteristic of a senior engineer is consistent and solid good judgment. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=296))
- Generation X (and even more so, Generation Y) are cultures of immediate gratification. I’ve worked with a staggering number of engineers who expect their “career path” to take them to the highest ranks of the engineering group inside five years just because they are smart. This is simply impossible in the staggering numbers I’ve witnessed. Not everyone can be senior. If, after five years, you are senior, are you at the peak of your game? After five more years will you not have accrued more invaluable experience? What then: “super engineer”? What about five years later: “super-duper engineer”? I blame the youth of our discipline for this affliction. The truth is that very few engineers have been in the field of web operations for 15 years. Given the dynamics of our industry, many elected to move on to managerial positions or risk an entrepreneurial run at things. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=300))
- I have some advice for individuals entering this field with little experience: be patient. However, this adage is typically paradoxical, as your patience very well may run out before you comprehend it. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=306))
- Discipline is controlled behavior resulting from training, study, and practice. In my experience, a lack of discipline is the most common ingredient left out of a web operations team and results in inconsistency and nonperformance. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=317))
- Each task you undertake should be approached from the perspective of a resident. Treating your position and responsibilities as long term and approaching problems to develop solutions that you will be satisfied with five years down the road is a good basis for the practice that results in discipline. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=320))
- The part that keeps me fascinated is witnessing the awesomeness of continuous and unique collisions between theory and practice. Because we are responsible for “correct operation” of the whole architecture, traditional boundaries are removed in a fashion that allows us to freely explore the complete pathology of failures. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=337))
- The first problem we hit was eventual consistency. Basically, this means you can’t guarantee that you can immediately read a file you just wrote. This problem was exacerbated when writing to the Seattle S3 cluster and then trying to read from EC2. We mitigated this by proxying all file access through our datacenter in Seattle. Unfortunately, this ended up costing a little more in bandwidth. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0043M4Z34&location=382))
