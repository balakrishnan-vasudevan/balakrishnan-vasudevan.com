## Highlights
- In 1994, the Russians had offered the Tube Launched Missile capability for the 877EKM's. The 10th submarine had the TLM capability. Later all Kilo’s except Sindhudhvaj and Sindhuvir received the TLM capability. All kilos with TLM anti-ship capability were also upgraded with Land attack TLM during the medium refits.

- The Kilo-class submarines have a displacement of 2,300 tons, length of 72.6 meters, the surface speed of 10 knots, a submerged speed of 19 knots (about 35 km/hr), test depth (maximum depth at which a submarine is permitted to dive) of 300 meters, the operational range of 6,000 miles (over 9500 km’s), an endurance of 45 days and a crew of 52. Armament includes six 533-mm torpedo tubes. The Soviets had made great advances in submarine sonars. The MGK 400 sonar fitted on the Kilo-class were also fitted on the INS Chakra (Charlie-I Class nuclear submarine). Indian submariners found the MGK 400 as an outstanding sonar, far superior to its contemporaries like CSU 34, which was of similar vintage on the Shishumar class. In the course of modernisation, the submarines are equipped with an advanced Russian Club-S cruise missile system (developed by Novator Design Bureau) with a firing range of about 200 km, Indian sonar USHUS and radio communication systems CCS-MK.
