## Highlights
- “Inside is a list of sites where we will deliver reports to you. We will signal which one we are using according to the protocol inside.” ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=457))
- “We will not send any other information electronically. I’m sure you understand my country’s detection capabilities in that regard. And this will be the last time we meet.” ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=460))
- “My conclusion as well. The head of Mossad doesn’t tend to travel abroad on short notice unless there’s an operation under way . . . the Israeli tradition that a leader should share in the dangers of the front line with his men. But I could hardly imagine they would try anything unusual on our soil. We are allies after all,” Lambert offered.

- “An absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, sir. Your silence might be nothing more than a demonstration of good communications security,” Kathy countered. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=559))
- Jonathan Burke stared at the massive slab of dark granite, not moving for ten minutes and ignoring the rude looks of tourists wishing the man would leave his prime spot in front of the rock so they could take their selfies. The American studied the hieroglyphs and demotic and Greek script, each character chiseled into its surface with some tool long rusted away into red dust. Two centuries before Christ, an Egyptian stonecutter had spent days carving each small symbol onto the Rosetta Stone to record Ptolemy V’s decree in three languages, no doubt aware that a single mistake, one wrong tap of the hammer on the chisel, would force him to start over, assuming the king didn’t have him killed first. It was, Jon supposed, one of the original pieces of bureaucratic art and he was amazed that such things existed. The twenty years he’d worked for his own government before his retirement had never shown him any sign that bureaucracies were capable of producing anything beautiful. Like almost everything else these days, the CIA outsourced its artwork. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=582))
- He found it disturbing and turned to look out the window instead. “Mossad kills four Iranians in London. I’m surprised that Hezbollah isn’t launching rockets into Tel Aviv by now.” “Maybe our first bit of proof that Salehi was telling the truth,” Kyra observed. “Iran wouldn’t have to ask Hezbollah twice to attack, and after Haifa, if one rocket came down on Tel Aviv, it would be an open war. Tehran might be giving us time to talk Israel down.” “It’s a possibility,” Jon agreed. “And it’s been two weeks since the bombing. If you’re Israel, that’s enough time to receive stolen intel from a Langley mole and put together a covert op if you’re motivated. It would be tight, but you could do it. So our first question is how long our insider has been operating.” “The timeline doesn’t rule out a mole volunteering to work for Israel because of the bombing,” Kyra suggested. “Assume ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=1026))
- he makes contact in the first few days after. He has to prove he’s not a dangle, so he has to give them something serious up front, and Salehi’s name and new job title would qualify. If that’s the first thing he gave up, that would maximize the time Mossad had to put together an op and get a team in place.” “That would make him an ideological mole,” Jon thought aloud, his eyes still staring off at some distant point in space. “If our hypothetical turncoat wants Iran’s nuclear program destroyed, maybe he can’t access all of the intel Mossad needs, so he’s pointing them at people who can.” “It might also mean our mole probably hasn’t passed much intel to Mossad yet. If he’s only been operating for a couple of weeks, they might not even have their ops plan worked out.” “Good news for Barron,” Jon replied. “For us, not so much. No other data to work with.” “If he’s ideological, he’ll be pushing to give them a lot more intel, and soon. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=1033))
- The ideological ones are always motivated to the point of being reckless. Penkovsky sure was. He dumped photo rolls by the dozen on his handler back in the early sixties. Scared his handlers to death,” Kyra added. “Our mole might make some mistakes and give us some freebies.” “Since when has our luck ever been that good?” he asked. ([Location 1040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=1040))
- “You’re asking me about the four reasons that people commit treason, right? Money, ego, ideology, and revenge. I’ve got money problems. I had a good career going until Aric got sick and people treated me like crap after I got back . . . still do, honestly. So there’s your ego and your revenge. That’s three of the four boxes you can check off. Sympathy for Israel is the only reason left.” ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=1208))
- Like most analysts, he’d studied the great counterintelligence cases—Aldrich Ames, Lee Howard, Robert Hanssen, John Walker, and a dozen others. ([Location 1267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=1267))
- Her superiors had approved Shiloh’s proposed communications plan. The man insisted on physical dead drops, to minimize the chance for NSA or some other intelligence service to intercept truly valuable reports that could point to him; but he preferred to signal those dead drops electronically. Mossad was comfortable with both preferences. Salem launched her web browser and visited a Facebook site, a Doctor Who fan page recently established and which approved very few new member requests. At the moment, there were only a dozen people in the group, and the moderator, Salem herself, was ensuring that the number stayed in the low double digits. She scrolled through the discussion thread until she found a new post made that morning by “Shiloh Litzman.” The Jewish surname was unnecessary but Salem assumed her asset was trying to show solidarity with her people.

- Just binge-watched Series 6. “Binge-watched” was Shiloh’s term for loading a dead drop. His comms plan had listed ten possible drop sights, each corresponding one of the “series” numbers. Series 6. She unlocked her safe, pulled out a hard-copy binder and checked Shiloh’s list, then replaced it and walked over to a colleague’s desk. “I need to make a run tonight.” “Where?” “Loudoun County. Forty miles west. I’ll need clean transportation.” The man looked at her over his bifocals, not sure he had heard her correctly. “Loudoun County? So far out?” he asked. “What cover for action will you have for that?” “No good one,” Salem admitted. “I’ll work up something.” The man frowned. He knew Salem did not make trivial requests. “Better you not get stopped. I’ll need a few hours to make ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MPZNG5Y&location=1420))
- She’d made the walk from the embassy on Van Ness Street back to the Cleveland Park Metro station, switched trains twice, then picked up a clean rental car, a black Ford Fusion, at the Reston Metro station left for her by another officer. She’d taken side roads to Leesburg to avoid the toll-road stations and their cameras, and made her way here following a map that she’d committed to memory. Her surveillance detection skills were as good as anyone’s in the Mossad, but that really meant very little. If the Bureau knew about her, they could surround her with so many cars that she’d never see the same one twice, and then it wouldn’t matter how good her training had been. Her instructors had drilled her and the rest of her class like whipped mules to beat the skills into them, but there were limits to how many license plates and combinations of makes, models, colors, and brands the human mind could hold. There could be cars all about her, and perhaps even an aircraft above her, made impossible to detect by the constant traffic coming and going from both the Dulles and Leesburg airports not twenty miles apart. Salem turned onto Evergreen Mills Road and stared in the mirror. There were no lights behind her. The Woods Road came up on her right at the end of a pine forest and she took the turn, no signal light. The road was wide and newly paved, running behind the local landfill, with no tree cover to hide her from a plane. After a half mile, the road bent to the right and began to wind through a section of woods where the trees grew tall. Salem killed the headlights and opened up on the gas. The road ran without a curve for a bit and she pushed the car up to sixty miles an hour. She navigated by what little moonlight made it down through the trees.

- The Quds Force and the rest of Iran’s security services would be searching through their holdings, looking for any tidbit that would single out any foreigner on Kish as an intelligence officer. Salem’s team likely had their own way off the island, perhaps an Israeli submarine stationed offshore waiting to surface, but Kyra had no such help on her side. She had only one way off and could only hope that the Iranians wouldn’t be stopping every foreign tourist on the way out.

- She marched across the wet sand and crawled into one of the small boats as two men pushed them out into the shallows and then heaved themselves aboard. The drivers fired up the motors and the dinghies surged forward through the low waves and turned south, running for the cargo lanes of the Persian Gulf. The Israeli navy had stationed the Dolphin-class submarine INS Rahav five kilometers south of Kish days ago; it had sat on the bottom a mere eighty-six meters below the surface. The gulf was shallow and the sailors had certainly heard cargo ships and Iranian military vessels passing only a few dozen meters overhead, but they were brave men, no less than her own team. The Rahav would surface on schedule, the Mossad officers would board with their equipment, and they would settle in for a cramped ride home, which would take a few weeks. Ronen would debrief her and the rest of the officers, and then she would go back to Haifa content that she had repaid the injury done to her home.
