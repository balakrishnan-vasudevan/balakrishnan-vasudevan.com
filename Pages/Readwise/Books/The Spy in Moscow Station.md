## Highlights
- Fulton also knew that Soviet dangles and doubles helped the KGB learn more about American espionage tradecraft. If CIA should take the bait and accept a KGB-inspired “walk-in” as genuine, they would train that volunteer in covert communication, use of special equipment, countersurveillance techniques, photography, and so forth, thereby showing the KGB how CIA assets operated, helping the KGB spot and apprehend real CIA assets.

- In addition, CIA case officers in Moscow were aware that fake walk-ins could unmask which Americans at the Moscow embassy were actually CIA officers, should CIA decide to accept the dangle. Equipped with this information, the Soviets could surveil that officer in order to unravel his connections to any Soviet “traitors” he had recruited. Entrapping a CIA case officer with a dangle also allowed the Soviets to score propaganda points by arresting and expelling the officer, while publicizing that imperialist spies were constantly trying to undermine the socialist revolution.
