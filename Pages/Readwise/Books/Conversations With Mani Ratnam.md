## Highlights
- The love stories say that you’ll die without this particular person, and you know that that’s not how it is. You don’t die, you just carry on. You may be hurt, emotionally broken, but you get back on your feet. Life goes on. You assume that you meet a girl and that’s going to be it for life, and then you realize you’re not exactly like that, that you could be attracted to or be involved or interacting with other women at the same time. You reveal a layer of yourself which surprises you, that nature has made you this way. It is this realization that’s the crux of the film.

- I still remember the introduction I wrote for my first consultancy report, where I’d said, ‘The attempt of this exercise …’ My boss told me that attempts finish with college. ‘We are here and someone is paying money for this report. So you can’t attempt. You have to clearly deliver.’ ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XYNZPWK&location=604))
- There are still a lot of women who walk around trees in prayer to get married, who don’t eat on certain days of the week so that they’ll get married—and here, there’s a girl who’s refusing to get married. So I decided that if I needed to make this accessible, I had to give the audience something that wouldn’t make them question the character, but they’d accept that as a plot point. And then the film can deal with the concept of an arranged marriage—two strangers suddenly thrown together, and how they find a way to adjust. That’s how her past with Karthik came in.

- When the scenes are doing the job, you don’t need a song. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XYNZPWK&location=1002))
- In our society, we bring up girls with all possible restrictions—with regard to clothes, with regard to talking with boys—and then suddenly, one day, we push them into a room with a strange man and ask them to start living with him. We educate these girls, expose them to the world, and yet, we expect them to toe the line in this matter. And however understanding the man is, the fact remains that he just wants to get his hands on her. So it is a huge process for a woman who’s able to think for herself.
