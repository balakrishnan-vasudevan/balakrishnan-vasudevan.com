## Highlights
- Forging an identity is like aging wine. You can’t rush it, and you have to follow certain steps. Most importantly, you need a solid foundation: a birth certificate, and there are only two ways of getting one. First, you can walk through a cemetery, look for headstones of deceased infants, and note names and dates of birth. You need to find one with a birth date close to your own and a name with the right ethnic background. With that information, you contact the Bureau of Vital Statistics in the county of the cemetery and order a certified copy of the birth certificate. If that’s not a viable option, a good lab can fake one—but they need to fake it well because the format and stamps, like Caesar’s wife, must be above suspicion.

- the forgery work for our undercover unit. A friend in the IRS identified a Social Security number within a few digits of mine that the Social Security Administration hadn’t issued. That number helped me land a Florida driver’s license. Then, through trustworthy friends at several banks, I opened checking, savings, and credit-card accounts.

- He recommended that I place my clients’ funds in numbered certificates of deposit that he could establish at BCCI Luxembourg. He also asked for documents on properties to serve as dummy collateral for loans issued by BCCI Panama. Though Luxembourg would collateralize the loans, BCCI would falsify its own records to suggest the Luxembourg accounts didn’t exist and the properties were collateralizing the loans in Panama. Loan proceeds, granted in an amount equal to my CD in Luxembourg, could then be transferred to a checking account in Panama maintained in the name of another company. From there, the funds would disburse to clients based on my verbal instructions to him. ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002JCJ6S4&location=1324))
- When working long-term undercover, I felt I couldn’t allow distractions that could cause a fatal mistake. My survival instinct forced me to concentrate solely on the case, which inevitably shut out my personal life. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to think about my loved ones or talk to them, but doing that posed a challenge because I frequently had to focus a hundred percent on that undercover world, absorbing every nuance, even if only in body language. I needed to be prepared totally, for anything, and the only way to do that was to think about everything constantly: what these people were likely to do next, how I could stay one step ahead. Each target became an obsession. At the same time, my loved ones got mixed signals. It increasingly appeared that I wasn’t the same—which was true, in a way. My mind was always elsewhere. I built a wall around my personal life in order to stay on track mentally while undercover. But even when I was at home, I couldn’t shake the habit. To combat this natural reaction to the unnatural environment of long-term undercover work, you need a lot of help. Awareness of the phenomenon is critical because it provides you with direction about how to try to cope. Physical conditioning was very important. I ran four or five miles almost every day and tried to eat right. Working eighteen-hour days over extended periods of time can lead to disaster if you don’t keep yourself in good shape.

- It’s also critical to build a bond with a contact agent who has little responsibility other than debriefing you, collecting evidence from you, and keeping you grounded. The contact agent becomes your confidant, but at the same time assesses how well you’re coping. Obviously that agent needs to have undercover experience because you can’t assess another undercover agent unless you’ve been there yourself.

- The smell of aromatic spices filled the house with warmth. Sheereen had prepared a rich and savory traditional Pakistani curried chicken dinner. Her humble grace offered no clue that her father had once commanded Pakistan’s air force and was now a respected politician. Awan’s father, Ayub Awan, former head of the Pakistani police and director of the ISI, Pakistan’s CIA, had semi-arranged the match. Awan’s roots in Pakistani Kashmir made clear why he was one of just a few bank officers managing CIA accounts that fed money to Afghan freedom fighters, many of whom later joined the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

- The rush of acting, the thrill of riding the cutting edge of crime, eventually numbs your senses, and years of this wear you down because the abnormal environment begins to normalize. You live by your lies. Outwardly at ease, you’re burning inside, checking and double-checking whether you’ve stumbled by offering any sign of your true identity. It’s almost easier to surrender to your role, but you can’t for even a second because you must also act as a minesweeper, gathering every hint of crime around you while pretending to enjoy the high life.

- Amjad Awan was deported to Pakistan after serving his prison sentence. He is said to be living in Dubai at the posh Marina Jumeirah Beach Towers. He travels frequently to Africa, Pakistan, and East Asia on unknown business. Akbar Bilgrami was also deported to Pakistan after prison. He is believed to live in the affluent Clifton / Defence Housing Authority area of Karachi, Pakistan. He dabbles in the stock market and provides consulting work to the financial sector. Nazir Chinoy, after serving his sentence, was also deported to Pakistan, where he is believed to live in Bath Island, Karachi. He sat on the boards of directors of several publicly traded companies, but in recent years his health has deteriorated. His businesses and wealth are said to be managed by his children.
