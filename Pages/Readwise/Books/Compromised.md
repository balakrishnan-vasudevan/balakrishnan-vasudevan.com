## Highlights
- Counterintelligence is the effort to thwart an adversary’s secret intelligence work. It has proactive aspects, such as protecting the targets of an intelligence service before they come under attack. It also has reactive elements, such as blocking or neutralizing what foreign intelligence services and their domestic assets are already doing. (Counterespionage—related but different—is catching U.S. spies who provide information to a foreign nation, usually, but not always, with the goal of trying to prosecute them.)

- At the end of the day, though, what separates an FBI counterintelligence agent from most of the U.S. intelligence community is the possibility of his or her work leading to prosecution of suspected wrongdoers in U.S. courts. The evidence developed during our counterintelligence investigations may form the basis of a legal action in which it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has taken place. And the evidentiary rules of a U.S. court must be followed in establishing that laws were broken. Unlike the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which conducts intelligence activity but has no direct law enforcement role, the FBI is a Janus-like entity, with both intelligence and law enforcement roles.

- While all member agencies of the intelligence community have critical counterintelligence functions, the CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA) play an outsized role alongside the FBI in performing the bulk of the nation’s counterintelligence work. All three of these agencies have an especially important role to play in counterintelligence, and often do it hand in hand. But we sometimes have different goals. For example, at its core the CIA collects intelligence; as an organization, information is the coin of the realm. While the FBI and CIA might both be aware of a spy in our midst, the CIA has always been interested in identifying everything we can about the operation: who the spy met; where the spy met his or her handlers; how they communicated; what the spy was tasked to provide. All those pieces of information provide a unique window into the hidden world of a foreign nation’s needs and vulnerabilities.

- But there are a slew of other types, like spotters, who identify others who might be sympathetic to working for us; access agents, who serve to invite us to places or introduce us to others; and agents of influence, who advance a line of thought helpful to us. Their roles are as diverse and arcane as the practice of intelligence itself. One bond unites them: the secrecy of their work for us.

- Counterintelligence work is murky, and hardly ever ends with clear conclusions. Rather than the criminal legal standards of probable cause and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, counterintelligence work almost always operates within a much less definite state of belief. Good counterintelligence officers rarely feel that they know much with certainty. It also means that sometimes they know enough to be confident that something happened but do not have enough unclassified or admissible evidence to prosecute it criminally. That’s true of most FBI investigative disciplines, and it’s particularly consequential in counterintelligence. “We can’t prove this beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law” often does not mean “This didn’t happen.” ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=503))
- I’d adjust my shortwave radio to the right frequency. Like clockwork, I would hear a Morse Code signal chirping away from deep inside Russia, mirroring a radio inside a closed-off room, chosen because it was on the opposite side of Andrey and Elena’s apartment from the bedroom of their two young sons. As Russia’s geopolitical realities and the technological landscape evolved, so did their tradecraft; after transmitting from near Moscow, broadcasts shifted to Lourdes, Cuba, and then back to Moscow, before finally giving way to Internet-based forms of covert communication. Despite the advance of technology, Russian trust in tried-and-true methods never went away. Andrey and Elena kept their shortwave radio for backup communications and still had it in their house when we eventually arrested them in 2010.

- The broadcast carried a weekly message from Center, in the form of hundreds of five-digit groups of numbers. They were scrambled with a one-time pad, a cryptography method dating to the late 19th century that required sender and recipient of codes to have matching pads printed with identical sequences of randomized numbers. The random numbers, when added to the numeric values of each letter in the message, encrypted the message contents. Those numeric codes were then broadcast, and the recipient with an identical pad decrypted the numbers. After each code was sent, the used encryption page was torn off and destroyed, and the next page of random numbers was used for a new message. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=582))
- While I listened to the broadcasts from Center, Carl would note which lights in which rooms would be turned on during the coded communications. Every week, Elena, the KGB-trained communicator of the two, wrote down the set of numbers through an earpiece plugged into the shortwave radio.… ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=587))
- We had yet to decipher the broadcasts, and if they were encrypted well, we might never crack them. But we made sure to monitor them without fail, because even the apparently random five-digit Morse Code groups held clues to the illegals’ secret lives. An unusually long broadcast might mean something major was brewing. In another puzzling lapse of tradecraft, Andrey and Elena’s broadcasts paused when they were away from Cambridge, confirming that the broadcasts were intended for them and no one else. Sometimes they would send coded messages to Center on a special analog of carbon paper, which left invisible ink underneath an apparently innocuous letter to an accommodation address, a false address somewhere in an innocent country… ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=590))
- As we identified their phone numbers, we obtained court authority to listen in, and as we monitored them, we identified yet more ways they were communicating—cell phones, email addresses. All were added to the rapidly burgeoning stream of… ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=599))
- But the real payoff came when we broke into Andrey and Elena’s apartment. Months of surveillance had taught us what their neighbors looked like, how they dressed, who worked the night shift, who owned dogs and when they walked them. We knew their neighborhood better than our own. Dressed like a Harvard student and his father (or at least that’s how I presented it, an ageist dig to aggravate Carl), we entered their building when we knew they were not home. But we couldn’t just walk into their apartment. They lived on the middle floor of a triple-decker, the three-story clapboard apartment buildings built in the early 20th century that are ubiquitous in the Boston area. These buildings have shared entrances, common stairwells up to the top floor, and thin walls and ceilings. Many of the other residents thought they knew Don and Ann, but they didn’t know us. To make sure the neighbors didn’t make a surprise appearance during a break-in, we had to know everything about who lived above, below, and around the family. We monitored their schedules and workplaces, making sure they… ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=602))
- When Carl and I broke into Andrey and Elena’s apartment, a Flaps and Seals team came with us to make sure we perfectly covered our tracks and left nothing out of place. The kit that the team traveled with would be the envy of any professional burglar. They also brought cameras. Although digital photography was supplanting film, old habits die hard, and instant photography had its benefits. Every search consumed prodigious amounts of film, with pictures of everything from the location of the feet of a chair on the floor to the alignment of individual files and papers within a filing cabinet. As we moved from room to room in the apartment, the floors would fill with neat little stacks of Polaroid pictures, aids to recreating the scene exactly as it appeared upon entering as well as for detailed review and analysis after the fact to tease out previously unnoticed investigative information. Hiding the… ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=611))
- Illegals like Andrey and Elena represented one of the rarest elements of spycraft, and the most clandestine. A nation’s intelligence officers—trained government employees posted abroad—are the clearest and most obvious figures in intelligence work. They are posted under official cover, although they can be either declared or undeclared. Declared officers are what they sound like: their intelligence affiliation is acknowledged to the nation they’re stationed in. Far more frequently, intelligence officers are posted under cover, which in turn comes in its own two flavors: official and nonofficial. In the former case, think of an SVR officer claiming to be, say, a congressional attaché for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based at the embassy. The latter case—nonofficial—can be someone without any diplomatic accreditation who usually, but not always, maintains his or her true nationality. Officers under nonofficial cover, known as NOCs, enjoy a much greater degree of clandestinity—or secrecy, in layman’s terms—than those assigned to an embassy, but lack the most powerful protection afforded an embassy official: diplomatic immunity. If they get caught committing a crime, they’re probably going to jail, and only quiet diplomacy or a spy swap will get them back home. The final category involves the deepest cover, the illegals like Andrey and Elena. To the world around them, they aren’t diplomats or even Russians. They are just two ordinary civilians going about their lives. As an illegal, the more you limit activities relating to your past life, the better off you are. Andrey and Elena, who were two young Soviets who barely knew each until their country paired them for a lifetime of espionage, had two kids who were teenagers by the time their parents were arrested. We eavesdropped on their domestic disputes, their birthday parties, the ups and downs that any couple would have over the course of years of marriage. After following their activities closely for… ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=622))
- Moreover, surveillance is part of the unwritten rules of the game. Officers who serve a foreign intelligence service knowingly accept the risk and the consequences of spying on U.S. soil. Andrey and Elena knew from their training, during which they had performed at the top of their class to earn the right to deploy to the United States, that the Main Enemy had the most advanced and competent counterintelligence environment in the world and might identify and surveil them. Andrey and Elena and their illegal brethren, just like CIA officers overseas, knew that the cost of doing intelligence business was that they might fall under host nation surveillance. It’s just one of the cold rules of the road. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=659))
- The first was the ultimate backup system in the event the U.S. threw out or otherwise neutralized all the Russian intelligence officers under official cover in the country. The second, more insidious benefit was the constant flow of assessment information they sent back to Center. As Andrey went through life as Don, the Kennedy School student, he rubbed elbows with students from around the U.S. and the world. Many were connected to their respective governments or destined for powerful positions in business. Andrey would note their personalities, their likes and dislikes, their quirks. Did they have a hobby, like cycling? Were they prone to drinking too much and talking too much when they did? All of it was quietly noted, shared ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084ZF5D65&location=679))
- We need to talk on a secure line, the friend said. Hold on, I said. I extracted the cryptographic key from the safe and inserted it into my secure desk phone. With the call now encrypted, my friend swore me to silence, then made an offer no one in their right mind would refuse.
