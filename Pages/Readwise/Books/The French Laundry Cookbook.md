## Highlights
- When you acknowledge, as you must, that there is no such thing as perfect food, only the idea of it, then the real purpose of striving toward perfection becomes clear: to make people happy. That’s what cooking is all about. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=79))
- This is the great challenge: to maintain passion for the everyday routine and the endlessly repeated act, to derive deep gratification from the mundane. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=85))
- Another source of pleasure in cooking is respect for the food. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=89))
- Respect for food is a respect for life, for who we are and what we do. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=91))
- “If you’re a really good cook,” he said, “you can go back in time.” ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=98))
- Take your time. Take a long time. Move slowly and deliberately and with great attention. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=101))
- A recipe has no soul. You, as the cook, must bring soul to the recipe. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=103))
- But you won’t have a perfect one if you merely follow my instructions. If you don’t feel it, it’s not a perfect custard, no matter how well you’ve executed the mechanics. On the other hand, if it’s not literally a perfect custard, but you have maintained a great feeling for it, then you have created a recipe perfectly because there was that passion behind what you did. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=105))
- When in Doubt, Strain: ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=237))
- gribiche sauce ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=242))
- blini ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=243))
- coulis— ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=245))
- beurre monté, ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=247))
- STRAIN AND SKIM. When in doubt, strain. Not a single liquid or purée moves from one place to another at the restaurant except through some kind of strainer. And you must always be skimming—skim, skim, skim. ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=258))
- If you’re using an electric stove, remember that the coil takes longer to go from high to medium-low than a gas flame. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=261))
- The initial bite is fabulous. The second bite is great. But by the third bite—with many more to come—the flavors begin to deaden, and the diner loses interest. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=279))
- What I want is that initial shock, that jolt, that surprise to be the only thing you experience. So I serve five to ten small courses, each meant to satisfy your appetite and pique your curiosity. I want you to say, “God, I wish I had just one more bite of that.” And then the next plate comes and the same thing happens, but it’s a different experience, a whole new flavor and feel. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=283))
- The way to keep the experience fresh is not by adding more flavors, but rather by focusing more on specific flavors, either by making them more intense than the foods from which they come, or by varying the preparation technique. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=286))
- glaçage. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01L0SSK3O&location=295))
