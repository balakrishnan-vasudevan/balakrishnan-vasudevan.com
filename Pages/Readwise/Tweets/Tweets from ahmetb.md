- Exciting news! I've joined @LinkedIn Compute Infrastructure team this week as a Sr. Staff Engineer. I’m thrilled to continue working on Kubernetes here. 🎉 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmetb/status/1641496996212244480))
- In case we open hiring at <a href="https://twitter.com/LinkedInEng">@LinkedInEng</a> soon: I'm looking to meet staff-level infrastructure engineers interested in working on compute fleet management space with me.
  We run an on-prem fleet of mid 6-digit number of machines, with our in-house IaaS stack built from the ground up, and all of this will eventually run Kubernetes (we're already serving parts of the website via k8s).
  This role is mainly around building cluster management systems and automation, and broadly contributing to the Kubernetes infrastructure in the company. This is **not** a DevOps/SRE role, and we're looking for systems design, development and ideally past compute experience.
  Please DM or send a message on LinkedIn. 👋🏼 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ahmetb/status/1720175817714720918))
