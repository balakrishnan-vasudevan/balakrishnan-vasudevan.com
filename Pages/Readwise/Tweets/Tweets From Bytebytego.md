- Netflix Tech Stack - Part 1 (CI/CD Pipeline)
  Planing: Netflix Engineering uses JIRA for planning and Confluence for documentation.
  Coding: Java is the primary programming language for the backend service, while other languages are used for different use cases.
  Build: Gradle is mainly used for building, and Gradle plugins are built to support various use cases.
  Packaging: Package and dependencies are packed into an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for release.
  Testing: Testing emphasizes the production culture's focus on building chaos tools.
  Deployment: Netflix uses its self-built Spinnaker for canary rollout deployment.
  Monitoring: The monitoring metrics are centralized in Atlas, and Kayenta is used to detect anomalies.
  Incident report: Incidents are dispatched according to priority, and PagerDuty is used for incident handling.

- Understanding Database Types
  To make the best decision for our projects, it is essential to understand the various types of databases available in the market. We need to consider key characteristics of different database types, including popular options for each, and compare their use cases.

- Data Pipelines Overview. The method to download the GIF is available at the end.
  Data pipelines are a fundamental component of managing and processing data efficiently within modern systems. These pipelines typically encompass 5 predominant phases: Collect, Ingest, Store, Compute, and Consume.
  1. Collect:
  Data is acquired from data stores, data streams, and applications, sourced remotely from devices, applications, or business systems.
  2. Ingest:
  During the ingestion process, data is loaded into systems and organized within event queues.
  3. Store:
  Post ingestion, organized data is stored in data warehouses, data lakes, and data lakehouses, along with various systems like databases, ensuring post-ingestion storage.
  4. Compute:
  Data undergoes aggregation, cleansing, and manipulation to conform to company standards, including tasks such as format conversion, data compression, and partitioning. This phase employs both batch and stream processing techniques.
  5. Consume:
  Processed data is made available for consumption through analytics and visualization tools, operational data stores, decision engines, user-facing applications, dashboards, data science, machine learning services, business intelligence, and self-service analytics.
  The efficiency and effectiveness of each phase contribute to the overall success of data-driven operations within an organization.
  Over to you: What's your story with data-driven pipelines? How have they influenced your data management game?
