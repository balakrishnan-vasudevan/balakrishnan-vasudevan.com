## Highlights
- When reading discussions about tech comp, people often talk past each other because they have different mental models.
  This thread is an attempt to convey some mental models that people who want higher compensation might have. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1490826828017111040))
- One thing I've been trying to figure out, without success, is how to explain "simple" problem solving techniques.
  When people have a playbook that involves sophisticated techniques, that seems fairly straightforward to explain, but I don't know how to explain simple techniques. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1485005935386906627))
- Offer numbers from someone with 5 years of experience, currently making $300k/yr. They consider offers of $500k/yr so low that they're not even worth mentioning.
  I shopped around a bit and have found similar, in that large companies are willing to offer me >= 2x what I'm making. https://t.co/ONw3gwJI4a

- Despite the market already seeming bonkers high then, it has gone way up since then.
  E.g., a friend of mine who was "senior" at Google (there 4 years with no promo) now makes $750k/yr and got a level bump for changing jobs after FB and another company got into a bidding war. https://t.co/38VR7Ifjd1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1447997574556880902))
- What companies are known for having low (~5%) attrition? Off the top of my head, I can only think of two companies (Centaur & Automattic). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/891034859103297537))
- This is a nice illustration of how poor the most upvoted HN/Blind career advice is
  The claim is that at FB and FAANG companies, the way to succeed is to do pointless work that juices metrics, but that's directionally opposite of what I tend to hear from very successful people https://t.co/21ubOHeWT2

- What are examples of items/categories where you're really getting your money's worth at the high end, not necessarily in terms of utility, but in terms of the difficulty of producing the item more cheaply?
  I find the contrast between these vs. "brand" items fascinating. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1594428909831204864))
