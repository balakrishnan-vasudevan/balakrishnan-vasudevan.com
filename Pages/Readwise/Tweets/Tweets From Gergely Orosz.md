## Highlights
- Shipping to production: how do different types of companies typically approach this?
  Here's an attempt to visualize the differences:
  - Startups usually do few quality checks & move fast
  - Traditional companies tend to rely heavier on QAs
  - Large tech companies invest in infra: https://t.co/Z0wvf0gIMT

- How should we think about compensation? 
  Most people _only_ look at the number: and this is easy to compare.
  One thing I'm thinking about is outlining what is reasonable to expect: *especially* if you take lower compensation at companies that can't pay more. An attempt: https://t.co/cFtmrgbWIV

- As it's been ~3 years, figured I'll answer "What caused the Uber Eats glitch that allowed ordering free food for a weekend in India?"
  This was an outage on my watch. Given Quora is paywalled - can't post the answer w/o a sub - here's the story on idempotency & breaking changes: https://t.co/N6o4zETavF

- Six common types of migrations:
  1. Service replacement
  2. Service integration
  3. Service extraction
  4. Code/framework migration
  5. Data migration
  6. Infrastructure migration
  None of them area easy, but #5 and #6 especially risky and difficult. https://t.co/VnPS661fwE

- Writing about migrations, one of the most underrated topics in software engineering.
  We talk a lot about architecting/designing scaleable systems, but then at any fast-growing tech company the reality is you'll be doing tons of migrations. And probably doing them not very well. https://t.co/TRIm9lTGCT

- How do staff/principal/senior engineers (some of the most experienced engineers in an organization) get "stuck"?
  Here are my observations. What other situations have you seen where these people get stuck in their growth, and/or careers? https://t.co/yPPoOwvADa

- "How can we do migrations better?"
  I'm writing about this. The same toolset that allows for large migrations to be done as zero-downtime is a toolset that helps almost every migration.
  My thoughts so far. Anything else you see missing? https://t.co/wnsR1mZdg0

- The New York Times published the article 'Tech Companies Face a Fresh Crisis: Hiring' where they cover the hottest tech hiring market of all time.
  I wrote on the same topic six months ago, and the challenges this piece lists are almost all ones I advised to tackle ahead of time. https://t.co/x3lgDCcxV9

- @kelseyhightower Some cases:
  - When low latency is needed.
  - When modifying ledger contents is necessary in the future.
  - In cases when you need to adhere to GDPR (and right to be forgotten)
  - When a central authority can/should be trusted.
  - When it brings no advantages to alternatives. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1488247773489250309))
- Getting more messages along the lines of "I like my company, they treat me well, but I got an offer with a 50-200% pay increase as a sr software engineer. I'd feel guilty leaving."
  You now know your market value. 
  You can offer them to stay for XX% less than this value. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1480078200529199106))
- Here are the 5 most "impactful" and 5 most-read blog articles on The Pragmatic Engineer blog in 2021.
  Though my focus has shifted to the newsletter starting late August, I still cross-post some newsletter issues that are free for all subscribers.
  The list: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1475481960223055881))
- From a VP Eng: ‚ÄúWe completely revamped our compensation structure after your articles.
  For years we though we were top 75th percentile based on Mercer data we bought. Little did we realise we‚Äôre 75th percentile in Tier 1.
  It‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow but glad we are doing it.‚Äù https://t.co/mnkdqP2AX8

- From FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) the only company I regularly hear asking for compensation expectations early on, and proceeding with interviews only if this number is not too high is‚Ä¶
  ü•Å 
  Amazon.
  It‚Äôs a classic tactic to minimise what they pay. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1470285502465126400))
- Remote work is really picking up. A CTO friend with 15 YOE from Central EU was hoping to land a remote eng manager job for ~$150K/yr.
  After 3 months of prep, interviewing w a dozen companies, he got a $200K/yr+equity position as a sr engineer at his dream company (full remote). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1469012276774678530))
- Roles overlapping in tech and the intersection you should be beware of... https://t.co/zfe28Exrce

- Choosing the next company to work at as an engineer or engineering manager: how do you do your research to find places you‚Äôll consider? What has worked well for you?
  What are some underrated approaches? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1455917496163254278))
- "I hit Staff engineer and am unsure what next. What is your advice?"
  Do a stint in management if you've not done so. This is the single best thing you can do for your future self.
  I hope this also answers the question "I have the opportunity to manage, should I give it a go? https://t.co/qo56eKB50k

- For the record, at Uber, we're moving many of our microservices to what @copyconstruct calls macroservices (wells-sized services).
  Exactly b/c testing and maintaining thousands of microservices is not only hard - it can cause more trouble long-term than it solves the short-term. https://t.co/VL8opOh1BY ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1247132806041546754))
