- Indians who have applied for the the EB-2 visa / green card as an advanced degree holder, typically while on their H-1B, have seen priority dates move 5.5yrs forward in the last 2.5yrs!
  The progression of these dates is unpredictable, but this is a positive sign. https://t.co/oXnu2R943G

- 1/8 If you're an Indian or Chinese person in the US, immigration lines are long. You (and even those based in other countries) can land a Canadian PR in 1 year while staying where you are and become a Canadian citizen in another 3 if you move!

- 1/9 In 2022, the H-1B US Work Visa acceptance rate was 23% for undergraduates and ~39% for advanced degree holders.

- 1/9 Indians in the US on a work visa can't go home. Thereâ€™s NO appointments.

- 14 years ago, on this day 26/11, 150+ lives were claimed in the horrific terrorist attacks on Mumbai.
  Sajid Mir, aka Wassi, the LeT operations manager for the attacks, is ~45yo and alive. China in â€˜22 still blocks the India-US bid to add him to the terrorist blacklist at UNSC. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/debarghya_das/status/1596554773360091136))
