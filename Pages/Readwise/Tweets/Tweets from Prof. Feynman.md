## Highlights
- The Feynman-technique of learning:
  > Pick a topic you wanna understand and start studying it
  > Pretend to teach the topic to a classroom
  > Go back to the books when you get stuck
  > Simplify and use analogies!
  â€¢ If you wanna master something, teach it. ðŸ§  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1421697216310222854))
- If a child can do advanced math, speak multiple languages, and get top grades in school, but can't manage their emotions, practice conflict resolution, handle stress, none of that other stuff is really going to matter. ðŸ§  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1413359414652772354))
- â€¢ Study hard.
  â€¢ What others think of you is none of your business.
  â€¢ It's OK not to have all the answers.
  â€¢ Experiment, Fail, Learn and Repeat.
  â€¢ Knowledge comes from experience.
  â€¢ Imagination is important.
  â€¢ Do what interests you the most.
  â€¢ Stay curious. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1347949975662051328))

- It's Okay to say "I don't know!" 
  There's no shame in that! The only shame is to pretend that we know everything. Illusion of knowledge is more dangerous than ignorance. ðŸ§  https://t.co/j7MJll5YnP

- The FEYNMAN technique of learning:
  STEP 1 - Pick and study a topic
  STEP 2 - Explain the topic to someone, like a child, who is unfamiliar with the topic
  STEP 3 - Identify any gaps in your understanding 
  STEP 4 - Review and Simplify! ðŸ§  ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1279123916372365312))
- â€¢ Stupidity: You think you know everything, without questioning. 
  â€¢ Intelligence: You question everything you think you know. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1278376350253023235))
- Five Productivity FEYNMAN strategies for Learning: ðŸ§ 
  i) See every challenge as an opportunity.
  ii) Understanding is more important than memorization.
  iii) Embrace uncertanties and doubts.
  iv) Think and Focus deeply.
  v) Learn from your mistakes and start over again. https://t.co/BLCbuf6e22

- Feynman learning strategy in three points: 
  1. Continually ask "Why?" 
  2. When you learn something, learn it to where you can explain it to a child. 
  3. Instead of arbitrarily memorizing things, look for the explanation that makes it obvious. https://t.co/yejfhYF0Eu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1681871421209825280))
