## Highlights
- I wish recruiters stopped asking "What is your expected salary" My response "I gauge how serious a comp is about hiring me based on what they provide. I look forward to hearing what they are offering. You can share your range + I'll let you know if I'd continue this conversation" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/susanabenavidez/status/1224765655624253440))
