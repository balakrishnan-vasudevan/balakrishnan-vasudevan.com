## Highlights
- I worked 2 years each at Meta, Airbnb and Netflix. Their engineering stacks are different and cultures have pros and cons.

  Stack I used: Hive, Spark, HDFS, Dataswarm, Unidash, Deltoid 
  Pros: 
  Tons of motivated people willing to help you
  Great social events to make friends
  Food was amazing 
  Cons: 
  Work-life balance isn’t great 
  Analytics organizations didn’t really care about tech debt
  - Netflix 
  Stack I used: Spark, Pig, S3, Iceberg, Meson, JanusGraph, Neptune, Postgres, Spring Boot, NodeJS, Apollo, Gradle
  Pros: 
  Extremely high compensation 
  High amount of freedom 
  Did the best work of my career here 
  Uber to work was a business expense 
  Cons: 
  Fear of getting fired 
  Food was okay 
  High levels of debate, the “loosely coupled, highly aligned” vision is more theoretical 
  - Airbnb 
  Stack I used: Spark, S3, Airflow, Superset, Sputnik, Wall, Gradle 
  Pros: 
  Work life balance was great 
  No return to office insanity
  Amazing data quality focus 
  Friendly culture of people who respect you 
  Cons: 
  Learning opportunities weren’t as good here 
  Design-driven culture for executive decision making
