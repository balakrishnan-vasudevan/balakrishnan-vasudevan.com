## Highlights
- Technical writing should be a required training for every engineering team.
  Many big corps mandate so many trainings for employees but the engineering workforce has little to no training on how to craft good design documents. 
  Quality varies so wildly between teams. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1567921940798783499))
- VLDB is the premier conference on databases and storage, and this year‚Äôs industry track is unreal!
  - RAMP-TAO: Layering Atomic Transactions on Facebook‚Äôs Online TAO Data Store
  - The evolution of Amazon Redshift

- The general idea being: loadbalancing strategy is going be tailored to traffic patterns and what you wish to optimize (avg and tail latency, for example). 
  It then follows that downscaling traces based on the same criteria helps retain fidelity with the actual traffic. https://t.co/jOtKyptkx9

- Started writing something about zero downtime deployments since most existing literature overly generalize (blue-green vs rolling etc) and the devil is often in the detail.
  But it‚Äôs down a total rabbit hole once you start breaking things down and doesn‚Äôt fit on a single slide. https://t.co/qoTPahVrjC

- The existence of 27 year old ‚Äúdirectors/VPs of engineering‚Äù in SF is probably one of the many reasons why titles, while important in some contexts, shouldn‚Äôt be taken very seriously in many others.
  I said what I said. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1342345137280565250))
- TIL a couple things about bash I didn‚Äôt know before:
  ~+ the current working directory
  ~- the previous working directory
  >| forced redirection (even if noclobber is set)
  Kinda convinced the best way to learn bash (terrible idea) is to just read bash scripts written by others ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1293026761823752192))
- There a newish German bakery a couple of blocks down the road from my house and for the first time in in my 8+ years in the U.S., I had a Black Forest cake that was the genuine article! 
  If you live in Lower Haight/SF and want to support a woman owned business, stop right by! https://t.co/P3eksVAyZj

- Finally got around to reading this absolutely EPIC post by @clare_liguori on CI/CD at AWS which covers everything from:
  - unit testing
  - integration testing (in prod!)
  - backward compatibility testing
  - staged rollouts in "waves"
  - automated rollbacks

- As the decade almost comes to a close, I wanted to ask the developer community: 
  what has been the most transformative tool/process/workflow that originated in this decade (2010-2019)? 
  The one that has had an outsized impact on your development process or your organization? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1208115082900566016))
- I ‚ù§Ô∏è getting new books!!
  I‚Äôd preordered this book and today it arrived! 
  @stripepress publish the best looking books! Everything about the book - the cover, the paper, the colors, the font - looks stunning! https://t.co/MwMoliXHoU

- What‚Äôs the most memorable outage you‚Äôve ever been a part of? 
  It could be ‚Äúmemorable‚Äù for a number of reasons - customer impact, you learned some important lesson, data loss, catastrophic failure, led to some profound realization, made you quit your job, changed culture etc. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1261006726519615488))
- The word ‚Äúsenior engineer‚Äù becomes meaningless in a world where the first requirement for a ‚Äúsenior‚Äù eng job listing is ‚ÄúX years of experience‚Äù. 
  It also means nothing in SF where people with 3 years of experience are called ‚Äúsenior engineers‚Äù. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1260347609610219520))
- You can expect some convos to crop up on twitter every 2-3 months like clockwork: üòÖ
  - friday deploys
  - should you work weekends and nights to be successful
  - ssh into prod
  - do job titles matter
  - do degrees matter
  - do algorithms/data structures matter
  - should managers code ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1257455538696265734))
- @jhscott Didn‚Äôt stripe blog about its own api rate limiters a while ago? You‚Äôre looking for ... api rate limiters? Intra service traffic rate limiters? Edge (cdn/ edge proxy) rate limiters? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1254985764854611974))
- Autopilot: Workload autoscaling at Google
  - dynamic vertical + horizontal autoscaling
  - unlike k8s, the proc doesn't get killed when the static limits for CPU, memory is exceeded
  - a *functional* architecture with a control loop (reminds me of PID loops used in some AWS systems) https://t.co/zI4SJw68Q3

- An ontology of ‚Äústateful‚Äù systems ... 
  Or at least my attempt at it.
  All stateless systems are stateless in no more than 4 ways.
  All stateful systems are stateful in ... 21 possible ways?
  With examples from Kafka (sticky partitioning), Cassandra (hunter handoffs) and Redis. https://t.co/JXlcILDQ3J

- Wow! Some amazing papers have been accepted to Eurosys this year. Highlights:
  1. Borg: the Next Generation (OMG! üòç)
  2. A Fault-Tolerance Shim for Serverless Computing 
  3. Autopilot: workload autoscaling at Google
  4. SEUSS: Skip Redundant Paths to Make Serverless Fast ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1250597980790386688))
- For all the talk of infra as code, in my entire career all I‚Äôve seen is code that‚Äôs a tangle of shell scripts, or an unholy amount of json/yaml, jinja (hello ansible), Ruby or cloud formation templates. 
  Or even before, things like boto + fabric (remember?) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1250161051015897088))
- Looked a bit into @PulumiCorp today and it looks amazing! 
  Over all other programming languages used in the ‚Äúinfrastructure as code‚Äù space (HCL, cloud formation, yaml), this looks the most promising. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1250161050336411648))
- - Microservices are hard.
  - Building reliable and testable microservices is a lot harder than most folks think
  - Effectively *testing* microservices requires a ton of tooling and foresight.
  - A Netflix/Uber style microservices isn't required by many (most?) orgs.
  - Macroservices? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1247130488667394049))
- Shoe me your bookshelves! 
  Here‚Äôs mine: 
  2020: my home in SF
  2017: my old home in SF prior to downsizing.
  2015: my bedroom in my parents‚Äô house. My sister says there used to be a time, before I moved to SF, when I was somewhat cultured, well-read and somewhat cool even. https://t.co/QwzrRNsmsd

- Also cleaned out my bookshelf! 
  If I‚Äôm going to be staying inside my house almost all the time, might as well make the place somewhere I really like staying lol, as opposed to calling a cleaner once every month or three. 
  I think I‚Äôm finally learning how adult (verb) well. https://t.co/XH1h0mep1n

- It‚Äôs even worse when people talk about requests/day or requests/hour. 
  And not to mention, when talking about rps, most people often mean the ‚Äúaverage rps‚Äù. 
  Which again means just as much as average latency does. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1215399259190611968))
- Subtweeting here: 
  Requests/second is a garbage metric. 
  It means jack shit unless you‚Äôre willing go into what kind of request you‚Äôre serving, what the cache hit ratio is, what your traffic distribution looks like, what‚Äôs the expected response time and more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1215398960900104192))
- 4. SplitFS: Reducing Software Overhead in File Systems for Persistent Memory 
  5. Risk-based planning for evolving data-center networks 
  6. Scalable and Practical Locking with Shuffling 
  See all papers here https://t.co/mY5HmGDCE1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1159718574417575936))
- 2. The Prefix Inflection Theorem: A Principled Debugging Approach for Locating Root Cause 
  Well, well ... this should be interesting! Do they mean "Proximate Cause" or can root cause really be located? üëø
  3. Snap: a Microkernel-Inspired Approach to Host Networking from Google ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1159718573213798400))
- ZOMG - just saw this year's accepted SOSP papers üî• 
  The ones I'm most excited about (in no order):
  1. Taiji: Managing Global User Traffic for Large-Scale Heterogenous Internet Services at the Edge
  This is by the team at Facebook that wrote the Maelstrom and Kraken papers! üòç ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1159718572098084864))
- This post on the evolution of client side (distributed w/o coordination) load balancing at Twitter is ü§Ø 
  - [service] "mesh" topology + P2C has cons
  - the "random aperture" approach which scales unfairly
  - "deterministic random aperture" scalable + fair
