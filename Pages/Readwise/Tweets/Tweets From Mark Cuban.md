## Highlights
- I wish Biden would come out and say he wants Trump on the ballot. The 14th doesn't apply. Then thanks him for the playbook describing how to never leave office and the appreciation of knowing he can't be charged, no matter what he does. And ends it with " My Fellow Americans , I'm not ever going to leave the White House and there is nothing you can do to me. "
  Which would confirm exactly why SCOTUS will keep Trump off the ballots and why Trump will never get immunity ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1741537504124162193))
