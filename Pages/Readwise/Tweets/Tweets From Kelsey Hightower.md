## Highlights
- I was 32 years old when I started learning Kubernetes. It's never too late to get started because you'll be learning for the rest of your life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1337611593761267712))
- This Thursday I'll be moderating the @steadybithq webinar focused on proactively improving system reliability through chaos engineering. 3 talks, 1 fireside chat, and plenty of Q/A. https://t.co/HZxtUjw8P5 https://t.co/s4tu5UOpEL

- You can run databases on Kubernetes because it's fundamentally the same as running a database on a VM. The biggest challenge is understanding that rubbing Kubernetes on Postgres won't turn it into Cloud SQL. ðŸ§µ https://t.co/zdFobm4ijy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1624081136073994240))
- Senior engineers can learn to share the credit. Find co-founders for their best ideas. Example: Pull in mid-level and junior engineers into the planning phase of a project such as design sessions with product teams so they can earn credit for strategic work vs being handed todo items later on via Jira tickets. Create design docs together and ensure your co-founders names are listed at the top. This will help mid-level and junior engineers establish creditability across the organization. Doing things like this turns your idea into our idea.
  Senior engineers can delegate an important task or feature, with high visibility, that would only take them 3 weeks to complete to a mid-level engineer understanding it will take them 2 months, and provide the necessary air cover. The air cover part is important because there will be a lot of pressure to get it done as fast as possible instead of investing in others, but you have to push back and quote 2 months instead of 3 weeks. Over that 2 month period, the goal is to establish a feedback loop that allows the mid-level engineer to experiment, make mistakes, and get help when they need it. The feedback loop can be code reviews or a daily standup, the format doesn't matter as long as it's consistent and actionable.
  The role of a senior engineer in the above situation is to create room for a mid-level engineer to grow and get hands on experience with a high impact project. If things aren't looking great after the first 5 weeks, the senior engineer can always jump in and help complete the task in the same 3 weeks as before, but you won't do it alone. Instead the senior engineer should pair everyday with the mid-level engineer so they can see how they approach problems like this. Mid-level engineers can compare their approach over the last 5 weeks with the senior engineer's approach over the next 3 weeks, and guess what, the project gets done on time, in 2 months. 
  Senior engineers can create other senior engineers by creating opportunities and sharing the success or failure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1724456798621696506))
