## Highlights
- "Log Everything" is:
  a) logically impossible
  b) a bottomless money pit
  c) mostly junk (boring things being infinitely more common than interesting things)
  d) ends up with a heavy bias towards errors, and
  e) causes good people to lurch desperately towards bad ideas (like "AI") ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1307055891808747521))
- anyone have any excellent interview questions for engineering managers, or good interview processes/experiences to report on? (or tire fire questions, for the entertainment value ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜ˆ) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/1286485343370276866))
