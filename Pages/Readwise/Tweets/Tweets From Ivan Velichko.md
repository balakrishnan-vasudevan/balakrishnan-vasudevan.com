## Highlights
- "Containers are just Linux processes" is a popular misconception.
  In reality, containers are as much about files as about processes.
  Here is how you can learn it yourself üëá

- Debunking Container Myths üßµ
  A (never-ending) series of articles that I started writing a couple of years ago to fix my own misconceptions about containers üîΩ https://t.co/bD7Iw48ere

- Kubernetes basics explained by analogy üßµ
  ...or "How Kubernetes Just Repeats Good Old Deployment Patterns"
  1. For a long time, people had been deploying services as groups of virtual (or physical) machines.
  But VMs were often slow and bulky. Hence, not very efficient. https://t.co/u5c8vmSx4V

- I wish this article existed when I'd been learning Kubernetes RBAC.
  My fav kind of explanation:
  - Start from a clear problem: how to do access control
  - Show a technology-agnostic solution
  - Map it to K8s primitives: Roles/RoleBindings/ClusterRoles, etc.

- How to debug issues in containers üîΩ
  You started a server in a container. It's supposed to open a bunch of ports. The container is running fine, but you cannot connect to some of the ports from the outside. You exec into the container, but `ss` is not there. Now what? https://t.co/AUXsOA0Fbs

- Kubernetes Admission Webhooks illustrated üîΩ
  By registering a webhook, it's possible to customize the request processing logic of the Kubernetes API server. https://t.co/pNNZc0RbBS

- How to grasp Containers and Docker (Mega Thread)
  When I started using containers back in 2015, I thought they were tiny virtual machines with a subsecond startup time.
  It was easy to follow tutorials from the Internet on how to put your Python or Node.js app into a container... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1423984739514454033))
- TIL: How to create Kubernetes manifests real quick ü§Ø
  Use kubectl create --dry-run=client -o yaml
  Example:
  ```
  kubectl create deployment foo \
  --image=nginx:1.21 \
  --dry-run=client \
  -o yaml
  ``` ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/iximiuz/status/1483180111579000834))
- Have you ever been confused while reading Kubernetes API docs?
  Wondering what are these:
  - API groups
  - Resources
  - Namespaces
  - API objects
  - CRDs
  - Aggregation layers
  ...and what are their relationships?
  I've got a picture for you!

- How to Debug Distroless/Slim Containers üîΩ
  Slim containers are smaller, faster, and more secure.
  But these benefits come at a price - they lack the exploration and debugging tools.
  Here are 4 ways to debug slim containers üëá https://t.co/1ciYSbPYFE

- I made a tool... to debug containers üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  It's like "docker exec", but it works even for containers without a shell (scratch, distroless, slim, etc).
  The "cdebug exec" command allows you to bring your own toolkit and start a shell inside of a running container.

- How To Grasp Container Networking üßµ
  A tricky topic... Container networking can feel like magic at times. But it's not!
  Rather it's a bunch of more primitive "LEGO bricks" like net namespaces, veth pairs, and bridges combined into a handy (but complex) higher-level abstraction. https://t.co/xfqayHs2aR

- Want to master Docker and become a container expert
  ...but don't know how to even start? üîΩ
  Here is the learning order that helped me:
  1. Containers: how Linux does them
  2. Images: why they are needed
  3. Managers: many containers, one host
  4. Orchestrators: many hosts, one app https://t.co/HaXaGnSMkU

- What is Service Discovery - in general, and in Kubernetes üßµ
  Services (in Kubernetes or not) tend to run in multiple instances (containers, pods, VMs). But from the client's standpoint, a service is usually just a single address.
  How is this single point of entry achieved? https://t.co/N86Wj8YaCG
