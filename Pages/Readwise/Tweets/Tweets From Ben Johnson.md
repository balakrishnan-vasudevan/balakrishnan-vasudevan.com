## Highlights
- My rule of thumb is that you’ll probably spend at least $1M to move to Kubernetes. That’s new ops hires, training, initial productivity loss, etc. 
  If you don’t have a $1M problem that Kubernetes is solving then I don’t think you should even consider it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson/status/1317561208229130240))
