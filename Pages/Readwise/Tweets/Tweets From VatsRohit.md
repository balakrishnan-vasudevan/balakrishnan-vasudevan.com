  - In 2020, then IAF Chief Bhaduaria visited the base and was briefed on infrastructure development at the base. 
  - I'm not sure about the completion timeline of this air base.

  - In 2018, GOI gave go-ahead for a forward air base at Deesa in Gujarat.
  - As you can see, it (2) sits almost in middle of Bhuj (1) and Barmer (3) and plugs the critical gap between these two IAF bases.
  - However, rate of development here is slower as compared with Phalodi + https://t.co/m7USGNnPos

- + ingress for PAF towards Ahmedabad and further inside at extreme end of Combat Air Patrol (CAP) radius from both Barmer and Bhuj.
  - Assume 200km radius from both Barmer (red) & Bhuj (yellow).
  - The intercepted area is at extreme range from both the air bases.

  - 2nd gap is in Gujarat Sector.
  - Distance between Bhuj (1) & Barmer (2) is more than 350km.

  - With Phalodi becoming operational, the gap between Jaisalmer and Bikaner closes.
  - Node 2 in map below is Phalodi.
  -> Jaisalmer-Phalodi: 136km
  -> Phalodi-Bikaner: 145km
  - Bikaner-Phalodi-Jaisalmer is an imp sector from land offensive perspective.

  - These bases are so sited so as to deny PAF access to India's hinterland.
  - But as the map shows, there are two geographical gaps in this chain.
  - 1st: Jaisalmer(1)-Bikaner(2) (265km)
  - 2nd: Bhuj-Barmer (360km if I trace a path inside India territory - curved red arrow).

  - As the map below shows, IAF's bases form a chain with each base separated by 130-150km.
  - These are India's first line of air-defense against intruding Pakistan Air Force fighters, base for conducting strike inside Pakistan and to provide ground support in their sector.

  - The above 'Keyboard Air Marshal' mapping exercise assumed 1 x MRSAM Firing Unit = 1 x Battery.
  - Hence, two batteries = 2 x Firing Units with 24 ready-to-fire missiles per FU. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KesariDhwaj/status/1436039451801636873))
- + enhanced to 100km.
  - In that case, the coverage provided by MRSAM increases even further.
  - In the map below, one MRSAM battery is 20km from Jaisalmer AFB, and other is in Phalodi (~100 km).
  - There is almost complete denial of airspace to PAF over Thar desert. https://t.co/9xAMzTyz75

  : Here again, both Akash batteries are assumed to be co-located at the base.
  : If you spread out the Akash batteries, the coverage will increase further.
