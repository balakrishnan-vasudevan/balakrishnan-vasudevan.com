## Highlights
- TIL about `git switch`.ðŸ¤¯
  Ever did a bunch of changes in a codebase, only to realize that you're working on `master`? 
  `git switch -c <new_branch>` 
  Creates a new branch and brings you local changes over. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/joel__lord/status/1501651233219743751))
