## Highlights
- If you're interviewing, when you're asked a Q do this:
  - Repeat the Q. Make sure you understand it
  - Ask for a minute to think. THIS IS CRITICAL. 
  - Structure your answer, SMART works, what's important is not be all over the place 
  - Ask if that answers or need clarification. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/decryptlyfe/status/1417610117789327362))
- Dear Salesforce SREs who are realizing if they make mistakes they'll be blamed and are afraid that their chief boss will and I quote "take action":
  I'm hiring SREs :)
  Blameless postmortems are a thing here.
