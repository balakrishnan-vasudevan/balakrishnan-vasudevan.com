## Highlights
- When I'm mentoring folks, two of the first things I share are:
  1. Learn how to only compare yourself to the present and past versions of yourself.
  2. Stop remembering things. Write everything down in a place where your future self can find it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/bryanl/status/1630593197561847809))
