## Highlights
- @GergelyOrosz @arj_shiv @ScottySword @nikovirtala I definitely knew if I was performing adequately or not, via the feedback provided by my peers / leader. I expected (and got) regular feedback.
  We also did yearly 360s, so I had a written set of things (goals) I could look back on and make sure I was adequately working towards. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/theckman/status/1515502665995747329))

- Well, as it's New Years Eve and I am the primary on-call for CORE SRE at @Netflix, it means I am paged every hour as people go to beg 2022 to not pull the shit that 2021 did.
  I hope everyone in CET and WAT did just your best! Happy New Year! üòÑüéâ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/theckman/status/1477054204761968640))

- In about 20 minutes I'll be starting my final on-call shift as an SRE on the CORE team at Netflix, with my last day being on the 13th. 
  What a wild 4 years and 5 months it's been, and I could not have been more fortunate to work with the people I have on my team (and at Netflix) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/theckman/status/1509934144125505536))
