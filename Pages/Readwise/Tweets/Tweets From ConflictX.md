## Highlights
- Geo-Imagery Observation series. Today, we have tried to observe PAF Skardu. An important base inside POK which lies in close proximity to LAC & LOC. The base came in limelight around Galwan Incident when it was said to be used by Chinese J-10. Which obviously turned out as fake. https://t.co/JGRIHBVI4n
