## Highlights
- #CIA Discloses Identity of Second Spy Involved in #Argo Operation. The movie about the daring mission to rescue American diplomats from Tehran portrayed a single officer Tony Mendez sneaking into the Iranian capital. In reality, the agency sent two officers.
  For the first time, the CIA has released the identity of that second officer, Ed Johnson, in the season finale of its new podcast, â€œThe Langley Files."
