## Highlights
- After using AWS for ~14 years, I've internalised a handful of design patterns that I try to apply to my own software. I'm keen to know if it's the same for other folks.
  Roughly: tags, IDs (thrice), limits, pagination.

- In the following AWS VPC architectures, can you send data from:
  A -> B?
  B -> A?
  A -> C?
  C -> A?
  What path do the packets (attempt to) take? What about the return path?
  The answers genuinely surprised me and has got me questioning my mental model of VPCs. https://t.co/SKSrFh32P8

- I regret to inform that I am extremely back on my bullshit.
  I've been thinking about connectivity in unusual places. And I got to thinking: can I establish bidirectional connectivity over the Internet between two EC2 instances in private subnets without a third-party relay? https://t.co/kMKb3138L4
