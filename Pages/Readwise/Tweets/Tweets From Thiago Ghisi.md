- Got a bunch of interesting questions about Big Tech Interviews over DMs in the last couple of days. 
  Sharing some of my answers here.
  Question 1: "Any tips on how to mentally survive a 5+ hour interview process?Â 
  I'm exhausted just thinking about it." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1503542948218253315))
- Such a powerful tool and such a rare thing to see leaders saying. It's definitely not easy to walk the talk.

- Loved this answer @LBacaj gave on his most recent interview with @RafatSarosh:
  Are there any tools, tricks, or hacks you have used on your day-to-day to be a very effective manager?
  The Engineering Manager "Say-Do Ratio" and how much that should be as close to 1 as possible. https://t.co/LYaNf0nUc6 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1498841172378329088))

- Still on Behavioral Interviews for EMs/Staff+:
  The STAR format is like a Three-Course Meal
  - The Situation/Task is the Appetizer, 
  - Your Actions are the Main Course, 
  - The Results are the Dessert, the cherry on top. 
  Donâ€™t overfeed the interviewer at any point, otherwise..

- I gave a talk, wrote a long-form essay, and am proud to share a podcast I recorded on the topic: How to Build a Strong Career in Tech.
  Modesty apart, this was one of the best interviews I gave. It came out really awesome!

- Got asked a super interesting question by a former engineer this morning:
  > Why is it that when you get promoted within the same company to Senior, you 99 out of 100 don't get paid as close as someone who joins from external?
  I thought I knew the answer...
  What is your take? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1489635644968218627))

- After my article about Behavioral Interviews last week, many folks asked me for examples.
  Today, have left that world, I'll be vulnerable and share the essay that landed me three $650k+ job offers at BigTechs last year.
  Question: What is the most innovative thing you have done? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thiagoghisi/status/1490737617008087040))
- I read a lot about Engineering Management. Of all writers I found this year, @scarletinked has been by far the most consistently insightful with 100% down-to-earth & actionable tips.
  This piece on How to Onboard Yourself in 3 Weeks at a New Job is a clear example of that!
