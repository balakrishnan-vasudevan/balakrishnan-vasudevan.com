- A typical web application responds to requests from bots, health checks, and various attempts to circumvent security and gain unauthorized access.
  So, how can you filter out those malicious attempts in Kubernetes? https://t.co/7wGudA8ZLy

- Should you use single or multiple Ingress controllers in Kubernetes?
  Most of the time, you might want to have more than one.
  Let me explain why ðŸ§µ https://t.co/LDUFERmrlb

- If you've ever interacted with a Kubernetes cluster in any way, chances are it was powered by etcd under the hood.
  But even though etcd is at the heart of how Kubernetes works, it's rare to interact with it directly on a day-to-day basis.
  Let's explore how it works in this ðŸ§µ! https://t.co/k6eHBHD1N8

- THREAD: How does the scheduler work in Kubernetes?
  The scheduler is in charge of deciding where your pods are deployed in the cluster.
  It might sound like an easy job, but it's rather complicated!
  Let's dive into it. https://t.co/iC1vnargc4

- THREAD: Isolating a pod for troubleshooting
  This technique helps you with debugging running Pods in production
  The Pod is detached from the Service (no traffic), and you can troubleshoot it live
  Let's get started! https://t.co/CP8ITh2lG9 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/danielepolencic/status/1612421361011400705))
- How does the Ingress controller really work in Kubernetes?
  I had to find out for myself, so I built one from scratch in bash https://t.co/r8naegmhhS

- Have you ever tried to ping a Service IP address in Kubernetes?
  You might have noticed that it doesn't work
  Unless it just works
  Confusing, I know

- How does Pod to Pod communication work in Kubernetes?
  How does the traffic reach the pod?

- When designing a Kubernetes cluster, you might need to answer questions such as:
  How long does it take for the cluster to scale?
  How long do I have to wait before a new Pod is created?
