## Highlights
- Wow. This SanDisk SSD model fails at 40,000 hours exactly. Primary and backup servers each had RAID-1 and they all failed at the same time.
  When setting up a RAID-1 mirror, always try to pair two SSDs from entirely different chipset makers. https://t.co/lpWadvefMe ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KentonVarda/status/1545814996726304770))
