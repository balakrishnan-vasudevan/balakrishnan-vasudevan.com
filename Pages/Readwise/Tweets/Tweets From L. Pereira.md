## Highlights
- Facebook interview, 2013. Couldn't implement a strstr() equivalent. Hours later, I implemented something that was essentially that (https://t.co/kdSTiXsMQi), it hit 1st page on HN, and a guy from their security team contacted me on IRC: "hey, have you thought about joining us?" https://t.co/qBl0uxKWnJ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lafp/status/1334319160822620161))
- Another one, which I eventually failed, but that I remember to this day. Google, 2012, phone interview for a SRE position. "How do you count all the set bits in an array of 32 bit integers?" "I'd use by using the popcount instruction, accumulating the value in an integer" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lafp/status/1334322326549143552))
