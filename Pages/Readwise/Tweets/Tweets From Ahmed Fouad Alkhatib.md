## Highlights
- **Hamas's intelligence/counterintelligence capabilities against Gazans?** One of the many factors that made Hamas powerful/dominant in Gaza for years is its intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities, which are far more advanced than those of most non-state actors. Through its own initial experiences in the late 1980s and 1990s, and thanks to critical training by Hezbollah and Iran's IRGC, Hamas developed sophisticated intel & CI skills that helped it grow its militant and strategic capabilities while minimizing penetration by Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and international parties. Later on, however, Hamas used its intelligence capabilities to cement its control over Gaza's population and disrupt any widespread/grassroots attempts at questioning the group’s legitimacy, agendas, authority, and rule.
  One of Hamas’s most potent strengths is its Counterintelligence (CI) skills/capabilities, which refer to a set of activities and efforts that are meant to protect against espionage, sabotage, assassinations, adversarial intel collection, as well as psychological & influence operations to deter dissent and cooperation with enemies. Examples of CI are allied deception during WWII, operations against Soviet spies during the Cold War, and efforts to protect against Russian/Chinese theft of U.S. military and commercial secrets. In the Gaza context, Hamas’s intel/CI was used to detect informants and foreign intelligence agents who would seek to collect information on the group’s assets, activities, members, capabilities, and strategic intent. Additionally, CI was used against the population to ensure compliance and disincentivize resistance and opposition to the group’s power.
  Hamas formed specialized intelligence units from its early days to gather information, disrupt adversarial plans, and protect the group’s secrets. After Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, it expanded its intelligence operations on two separate tracks: as a government seeking to entrench its rule, and, as a militant organization that wanted to expand its asymmetric warfare capabilities. The Internal Security Service (Jihaz al-Amin al-Dakhili) was formed in 2007 and became Hamas’s equivalent to Shin Bet or the FBI; it was used to go after Fatah/Palestinian Authority members and sought to prevent dissidents and opposition forces from gaining ground and undermining the group’s narrative and legitimacy. On the militant/al-Qassam Brigades side of things, Hamas’s military intelligence sought to collect information on Israeli targets, detect and expose Israeli informants and collaborators, and engage in deception operations to obfuscate the true intentions and goals of the group.
  Most damagingly, Hamas leveraged its vast intel/CI expertise to suppress Gazans and ensure that everyone fell in line and didn’t challenge the group’s hegemonic domination of the coastal enclave’s affairs. In a sense, Hamas used the tried and tested model that many oppressive regimes deploy against their people by using intelligence services as spearheads to enforce sociopolitical conformity and criminalize opposition.
  Furthermore, Hamas mastered the use of psychological and influence operations through proxies, agents, affiliates, and electronic warriors, especially on social media, to ensure that opponents and dissidents are regularly attacked, delegitimized, and discredited amongst Gaza’s population. Furthermore, psy/influence ops sought to disseminate and proliferate Hamas’s talking points across different Arab and international target audiences who supported the Palestinian cause. Domestically, the group monitored social media, international press coverage, current events, and emerging trends to ensure that its dis/misinformation warriors could be quickly mobilized to respond in a manner that served its interests and needs. Whenever Gazans would launch mass protests against Hamas, the group’s intelligence/CI capabilities would quickly be used to launch counter-protests, attack civil society members who opposed the Islamist group, and regurgitate propaganda around resistance, Islamic values, and the need to keep the focus on the Zionist enemy.
  The success of the October 7 attack was partly due to the group’s superior collection of intelligence on Israeli targets and engagement in a long-con/deception operation. Those who praise Hamas for being a “resistance” group fail to understand that the organization used decades-old intelligence operations and methods to suppress its people, jail dissent, criminalize free speech, label all opposers as collaborators and spies, and turn oppressive tools and tactics against its own people. In other words, it operated just like the Shah’s Savak, the Soviet NKVD/KGB, Gaddafi’s Mukhabarat el-Jamahiriya, Cuba’s DGI, or China’s MSS.
  Hamas famously ran torture dungeons that were operated by its governmental and al-Qassam intelligence services specifically to deter Gazans from speaking out against its regime. My own friends were tortured in these horror compounds, and the stories they tell me are similar to those you’d hear coming out of Syrian, Iranian, or Iraqi prisons that held opposition members. Anytime someone wonders why Gazans haven’t successfully overthrown the group, it’s essential to remember Hamas’s sophisticated and nefarious intelligence operations, which have prevented any meaningful opposition to the group. Below, I'll link to a video of Hamas's founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, talking specifically about the group's counterintelligence operations, and even admitting to torture as a way of exposing collaborators and Israeli informants.
  **Hamas is not a natural expression of resistance to Israeli occupation. Instead, the group hijacked the Palestinian national project, undermined the legitimate cause of resistance, aligned the Palestinian cause with horrible regional backers, and held its people hostage to a futile, narrow agenda that has resulted in Gazans’ death, destruction, dispossession, and displacement. Please think about this before deliberately or inadvertently supporting the disaster that is Hamas.** ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/afalkhatib/status/1746063018343960670))
