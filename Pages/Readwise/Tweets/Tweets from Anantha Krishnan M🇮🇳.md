## Highlights
- Here's a nice pic from @NewIndianXpress of CAS ACM RKS Bhadauria at #AFSSulur during #FlyingBullets event. And, those who pinged asking if all IOC versions can be converted to FOC, answer I gathered is YES. Barring the AAR, IOC block of 16 #Tejas can be upgraded. #Avgeeks 1/2 https://t.co/MU3J5l6Pmd

- #BrahMos missile's stupendous success story can be attributed to DNA embedded to the team. It inspires when top leadership at @BrahMosMissile gives free hand to youngsters. Hope 2 get them for @tarmaktalking soon. Meanwhile, enjoy this impressive launch of BrahMos from INS Kochi. https://t.co/42QR0TbjhE ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/writetake/status/1251053866688249856))

  Imphal (Yard 12706), Indian Navyâ€™s latest indigenous guided missile destroyer, scored â€˜Bulls Eyeâ€™ in her maiden Brahmos firing at sea. 
  This is the first ever test-firing of the Extended Range Brahmos missile *by a warship before the commissioning*, which underscores Indian Navyâ€™s unwavering focus on Combat Readiness, _AatmanirbharBharat_â€™s growing shipbuilding prowess and assured reliability of indigenous weapons and platforms.<video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1727192358612291584/pu/pl/m2LwZL_wx4f9Gh2L.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1727192358612291584/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/3iZ1e4fHljqLZsuQ.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1727192358612291584/pu/vid/avc1/480x270/xuLaRxG5QiTiuJX8.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1727192358612291584/pu/vid/avc1/640x360/FWjJpp7UdL9sL3Qr.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/writetake/status/1727192396985942182))
