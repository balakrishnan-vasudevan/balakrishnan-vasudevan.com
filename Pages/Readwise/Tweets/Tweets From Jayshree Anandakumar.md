## Highlights
- Woke up really early. Made lunch. Good swim session. 10K run and then a 30 min gym. Breakfast with @pawandewani. Started work as well. It's not even 11. It's been a good day already.
  Took a while to realize its less about motivation and more about routines. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jayshreeanand/status/1225654640835883008))
