## Highlights
- The point of reviewing your mistakes isn't to shame your past self. It's to educate your future self.
  Rumination is recycling old thoughts about what went wrong. Reflection is looking for new insights on how to do better.
  You can't undo last year. You can improve this one. https://t.co/DzWhI8fh4D
