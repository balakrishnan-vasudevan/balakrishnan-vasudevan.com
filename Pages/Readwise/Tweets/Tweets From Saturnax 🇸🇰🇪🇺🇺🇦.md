  I'm happy to share with you my first article on @thewarzonewire - a Cold War story of Royal Navy's HMS Swiftsure shadowing Soviet Kiev-class aircraft carrier.
  Thanks to @Aviation_Intel @CombatAir @OliverParken for your help!

  Here's my take on the Israeli Navy's latest submarine, the INS Drakon and her mysterious sail. Thank you @CombatAir for your help.
  Btw, lots of caveats and guesses...

  Browsing my Turkish Navy's photo folder I just realized their latest Reis (Type 214TN)-class AIP attack submarine TCG HÄ±zÄ±rreis (S-331) was launched in May 2023 with what appears to be a Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) propeller with a vortex diffuser. Interesting.
  3rd image shows a 6-bladed Carbon-Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) propeller design by Voith & MET (Motoren- und Energietechnik GmbH).
  FRP propeller design was developed in 2002 by HDW for the German Navy submarines using Siemens Fibersim software for composite design - 4th screenshot. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Saturnax1/status/1687546750305738752))
