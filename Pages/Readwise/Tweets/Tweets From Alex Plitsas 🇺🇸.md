## Highlights
- My great uncle, Robert Pagnucco, died on Pan AM 103. He was corporate counsel for PepsiCo. I recall watching my grandmother break down in tears when the news broke on TV. I had the privilege later on to meet the CIA tech ops officer who broke the case at a sabotage training course. He told me that the British had recovered the suitcase that the bomb was in and that he found a piece of the circuit board used in the bomb that had survived the blast with enough identifiers on it for them to trace it to the Libyan Intelligence Service. A few years later, Assistant FBI Director for Victims Services, Kathy Turman, was my partner on the White House Hostage Policy Review team. Come to find out, she had been my familyâ€™s victims liaison officer and was still in touch with my cousin, Raymond Pagnucco.
