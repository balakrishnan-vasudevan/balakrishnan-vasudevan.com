## Highlights
- Interesting 'breakthrough' at Stanford University using optical-acoustic sonar to detect underwater objects from airborne assets. There are some hurdles to overcome for field use and practicality, but the lab test show it works. Well done to Adian Fitzpatrick and his team. https://t.co/L7FgNDNGwU
