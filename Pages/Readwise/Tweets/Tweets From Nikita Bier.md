## Highlights
- Today my house appraised at 30% higher than what I bought it for. So my bank released the stocks I pledged as a downpayment.
  So my house is officially 100% financed with $0 down and locked in at a 2.25% interest rate.
  Yes, it is possible to get a free house. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/nikitabier/status/1849818428560880036))
