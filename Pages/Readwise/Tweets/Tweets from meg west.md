## Highlights
- I presented (virtually) at [ISC2](https://twitter.com/ISC2) Security Congress in 2022, discussing the key elements of an impactful incident response initiative. While I haven’t yet attended Security Congress in person, I’m very much looking forward to changing that next month when I attend ISC2 Security Congress 2024 on October 14-16 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. I even have a special code for my followers so you can come join me too, use “MEG10.”  
  If you’ve followed me on social media for any amount of time, you’re likely aware of the passion and support I have for ISC2 (https://t.co/KomW18nF0a) and its mission. Everything from the organization having a brilliant, hard-working, female CEO (in an industry where such a small percentage of CEOs are female), to the progressive work that ISC2 conducts assisting people in getting their first jobs working in Cybersecurity (Check out their “Certified in Cybersecurity” certification if you haven’t already! https://t.co/K4wQS7pt1S), to their passion in filling the cybersecurity skills and workforce gap… it all resonates and aligns with what I want for our industry. And above everything else - I’m very vocal about how acquiring the CISSP certification truly changed my life. Before I earned my CISSP, my brain was rampant with imposter syndrome. I was an early 20-something woman working on a team of all men, and I simply felt like I wasn’t good enough. Earning the CISSP truly gave me the confidence boost I needed to proliferate my experience  in the cybersecurity field, the hard work I’ve done to get to where I’m at today - working as a Sr. Cybersecurity Consultant at CrowdStrike - and to create the “Cybersecurity Meg” brand. Had I not earned the CISSP, I likely would never have had the confidence to present at conferences, to write blogs like this, and to attempt to clear the path for others to get into the industry with fewer obstacles than I had. 
  So, back to Security Congress. Have you looked at the line-up of workshops, keynotes, and networking events? If not, proceed to have your mind blown here: https://t.co/UFDJMKDb1C . The schedule is chock-full with invigorating topics, everything from securing AI to avoiding burnout while working in the industry (a personal favorite topic of mine, and a keynote session by Dan Harris, author of “10% Happier,” that I’ll be sure to be attending! Find information about the session here: https://t.co/ec5ne4OsOE). Given that we’re all aware of how AI is about to take over the world, I’m very pleased that Simon Salmon will be hosting a 2-day workshop to teach us about how to secure our organizations’ AI (Find information about the workshop here: https://t.co/UFDJMKDb1C).
