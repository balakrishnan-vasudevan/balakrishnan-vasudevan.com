## Highlights
- Secret coups and treasons rarely leave recipts behind. But Bajwa was so incompetent that he left many. Two of the main ones are these. Haqqani keeps trying to play up his importance, but his role was of just a messenger, just like molvi Adnan Iqbal. https://t.co/cVpUmxtDKX https://t.co/Jgfq69UAvN
