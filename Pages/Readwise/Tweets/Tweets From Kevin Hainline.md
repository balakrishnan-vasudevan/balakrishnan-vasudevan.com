## Highlights
- 1) I want to talk about this photograph. It's the first photograph ever taken of the backside of the Moon, taken October 7th, 1959. So, just a week shy of sixty years ago. You're probably thinking "What a crummy image!" WELL LET ME TELL YOU HOW IT WAS MADE OK https://t.co/wZ7HxYSsdA
