- Marriage wealth hack #7
  Long-term capital gains tax rate for married (filing jointly) couples is 0% up to $80,000 of investment income
  Aka the married couple who paid off the house, quit their jobs and now live off 4% of their $2,000,000 taxable brokerage are paying $0 in taxes ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thewealthdad/status/1427301214673321987))
- Will be getting a 9.1% bonus payout from the 9-5 on February 17th.
  Should be enough (post-tax) to cover my entire 2023 Roth IRA contributions, which I'll be maxing immediately when the bonus deposits.
  Wife and I have always used our bonuses to max out our Roth IRAs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thewealthdad/status/1618301732328738816))
- You really start to understand this when your portfolio hits the $500K - $1M range, to where a 1-2.5% daily gain is between $5,000 - $25,000.
  You then realize you *could* scale back on investing to live more, because your portfolio is now growing substantially all on its own. https://t.co/u1Gkorbu1C ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/thewealthdad/status/1680928381485891587))
