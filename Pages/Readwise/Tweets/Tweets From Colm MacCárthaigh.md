## Highlights
- I've made an incredibly basic single webpage application to practice the US Citizenship Civics exam over at https://t.co/ns3kjl3jUo. It gives you all 100 questions in a random order. The real test you need 6 correct out of the first 10. Give it a try if you're curious! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1516407770274095104))
