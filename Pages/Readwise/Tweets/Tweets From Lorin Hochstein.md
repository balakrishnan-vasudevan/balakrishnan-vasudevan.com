## Highlights
- Suggested interview question for a distributed systems position:
  For any one of the following, tell me about a time when you added it to a codebase where it wasn’t there, and why:
  1. timeouts
  2. sharding 
  3. jitter ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/norootcause/status/1567686200584196096))
- Looking for a notebook-like thing to keep track of details when digging in to computer stuff, want to be able to paste code snippets, images, etc.
  Don't like using gdoc or notion for this.
  Closest I've found is Quiver, anybody have other suggestions?

- Fun interview question for a senior SRE position: what’s a system limit that you first learned about when a service you were responsible for hit it and fell over? (Then ask them to recount the story). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/norootcause/status/1332781588246097927))
- Proposed tech interview question, for a senior position.
  Tell me about a time when you observed that:
  * conforming to best practices contributed to a negative outcome.
  * violating best practices contributed to a positive outcome.
  (Give them the question in advance) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/norootcause/status/1327746627323367424))
