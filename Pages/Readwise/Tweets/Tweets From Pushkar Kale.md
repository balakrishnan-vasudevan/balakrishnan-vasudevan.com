## Highlights
- Excited to read 'The Maratha Century' by @MulaMutha! Already loving the illustrations and maps, some of which are pretty rare. Unfortunately, Many Indians think Maratha history is only about 2-3 great rulers, such work will enlighten us about other less discussed people & events. https://t.co/X4V5yFw4iI
