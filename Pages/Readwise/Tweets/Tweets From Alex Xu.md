- How do processes talk to each other on Linux?
  The diagram below shows 5 ways of Inter-Process Communication.
  1. Pipe
  Pipes are unidirectional byte streams that connect the standard output from one process to the standard input of another process. 
  2. Message Queue
  Message queues allow one or more processes to write messages, which will be read by one or more reading processes.
  3. Signal
  Signals are one of the oldest inter-process communication methods used by Unix systems. A signal could be generated by a keyboard interrupt or an error condition such as the process attempting to access a non-existent location in its virtual memory. There are a set of defined signals that the kernel can generate or that can be generated by other processes in the system. For example, Ctrl+C sends a SIGINT signal to process A.
  4. Semaphore
  A semaphore is a location in memory whose value can be tested and set by more than one process. Depending on the result of the test and set operation one process may have to sleep until the semaphore's value is changed by another process. 
  5. Shared Memory
  Shared memory allows one or more processes to communicate via memory that appears in all of their virtual address spaces. When processes no longer wish to share the virtual memory, they detach from it.

- One picture is worth a thousand words - Top 5 Caching Strategies.
  When we introduce a cache into the architecture, synchronization between the cache and the database becomes inevitable.
  Let’s look at 5 common strategies how we keep the data in sync.
  🔹 Read Strategies:
  Cache aside
  Read through
  🔹 Write Strategies:
  Write around
  Write back
  Write through
  The caching strategies are often used in combination. For example, write-around is often used together with cache-aside to make sure the cache is up-to-date.

- What happens when you type a URL into a browser? The method to download the high-resolution PDF is available at the end.
  Let’s look at the process step by step.
  Step 1: The user enters a URL (bytebytego .com) into the browser and hits Enter. The first thing we need to do is to translate the URL to an IP address. The mapping is usually stored in a cache, so the browser looks for the IP address in multiple layers of cache: the browser cache, OS cache, local cache, and ISP cache. If the browser couldn’t find the mapping in the cache, it will ask the DNS (Domain Name System) resolver to resolve it.
  Step 2: If the IP address cannot be found at any of the caches, the browser goes to DNS servers to do a recursive DNS lookup until the IP address is found.
  Step 3: Now that we have the IP address of the server, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server. For secure access of server resources, we should always use HTTPS. It first establishes a TCP connection with the server via TCP 3-way handshake. Then it sends the public key to the client. The client uses the public key to encrypt the session key and sends to the server. The server uses the private key to decrypt the session key. The client and server can now exchange encrypted data using the session key.
  Step 4: The server processes the request and sends back the response. For a successful response, the status code is 200. There are 3 parts in the response: HTML, CSS and Javascript. The browser parses HTML and generates DOM tree. It also parses CSS and generates CSSOM tree. It then combines DOM tree and CSSOM tree to render tree. The browser renders the content and display to the user.

- The MOST Popular post of this week: How do companies ship code to production? 
  Next week's topics will be listed at the end.
  The diagram below illustrates the typical workflow.
  Step 1: The process starts with a product owner creating user stories based on requirements.
  Step 2: The dev team picks up the user stories from the backlog and puts them into a sprint for a two-week dev cycle.
  Step 3: The developers commit source code into the code repository Git.
  Step 4: A build is triggered in Jenkins. The source code must pass unit tests, code coverage threshold, and gates in SonarQube.
  Step 5: Once the build is successful, the build is stored in artifactory. Then the build is deployed into the dev environment.
  Step 6: There might be multiple dev teams working on different features. The features need to be tested independently, so they are deployed to QA1 and QA2.
  Step 7: The QA team picks up the new QA environments and performs QA testing, regression testing, and performance testing.
  Steps 8: Once the QA builds pass the QA team’s verification, they are deployed to the UAT environment.
  Step 9: If the UAT testing is successful, the builds become release candidates and will be deployed to the production environment on schedule.
  Step 10: SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team is responsible for prod monitoring.

- Best ways to test system functionality
  Testing system functionality is a crucial step in software development and engineering processes.
  It ensures that a system or software application performs as expected, meets user requirements, and operates reliably.
  Here we delve into the best ways:
  1. Unit Testing: Ensures individual code components work correctly in isolation.
  2. Integration Testing: Verifies that different system parts function seamlessly together.
  3. System Testing: Assesses the entire system's compliance with user requirements and performance.
  4. Load Testing: Tests a system's ability to handle high workloads and identifies performance issues.
  5. Error Testing: Evaluates how the software handles invalid inputs and error conditions.
  6. Test Automation: Automates test case execution for efficiency, repeatability, and error reduction.
  Over to you: How do you approach testing system functionality in your software development or engineering projects?

- Single Sign-On (SSO) explained in simple terms. 
  The method to download the high-resolution PDF is available at the end.
  The concepts of SSO revolve around the three key players: the User, the Identity Provider (IDP), and the Application.
  1. The end-user or individual who seeks access to various applications.
  2. Identity Provider (IDP): An entity responsible for user authentication and verification. Common IDPs include Google, Facebook, and company-specific systems.
  3. Application: The software or service that the user wants to access. Applications rely on the IDP for user authentication. With SSO, users can seamlessly log in to various applications with a single set of credentials, enhancing convenience and security.
  Single Sign-On (SSO) simplifies user access by enabling them to log in to multiple applications with a single set of credentials, enhancing the user experience and reducing password fatigue. It also centralizes security and access management, improving security, streamlining access control, and saving time and costs. Compliance and reporting become more accessible, and the integration is seamless, making it a practical solution for organizations seeking to enhance both security and operational efficiency.
  When the user tries to log in, the application redirects them to the SSO service, which serves as the Identity Provider (IDP). The IDP then authenticates the user, often by checking their credentials, and if successful, it issues a token or assertion verifying the user's identity. This token is sent back to the user's browser, which in turn presents it to the application. The application, recognizing the token as valid, grants the user access without requiring them to re-enter their credentials. This streamlined process ensures that users can access multiple applications with a single login, reducing friction and enhancing both security and convenience.
  Over to you: What's your perspective on the future of secure authentication in the digital realm?

- Symmetric encryption vs asymmetric encryption
  Symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption are two types of cryptographic techniques used to secure data and communications, but they differ in their methods of encryption and decryption.
  🔹 In symmetric encryption, a single key is used for both encryption and decryption of data. It is faster and can be applied to bulk data encryption/decryption. For example, we can use it to encrypt massive amounts of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data. It poses challenges in key management because the sender and receiver share the same key. 
  🔹 Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is freely distributed and used to encrypt data, while the private key is kept secret and used to decrypt the data. It is more secure than symmetric encryption because the private key is never shared. However, asymmetric encryption is slower because of the complexity of key generation and maths computations. For example, HTTPS uses asymmetric encryption to exchange session keys during TLS handshake, and after that, HTTPS uses symmetric encryption for subsequent communications.

- IBM MQ -> RabbitMQ -> Kafka ->Pulsar, How do message queue architectures evolve?
  🔹 IBM MQ
  IBM MQ was launched in 1993. It was originally called MQSeries and was renamed WebSphere MQ in 2002. It was renamed to IBM MQ in 2014. IBM MQ is a very successful product widely used in the financial sector. Its revenue still reached 1 billion dollars in 2020.
  🔹 RabbitMQ
  RabbitMQ architecture differs from IBM MQ and is more similar to Kafka concepts. The producer publishes a message to an exchange with a specified exchange type. It can be direct, topic, or fanout. The exchange then routes the message into the queues based on different message attributes and the exchange type. The consumers pick up the message accordingly.
  🔹 Kafka
  In early 2011, LinkedIn open sourced Kafka, which is a distributed event streaming platform. It was named after Franz Kafka. As the name suggested, Kafka is optimized for writing. It offers a high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. It provides a unified event log to enable event streaming and is widely used in internet companies.
  Kafka defines producer, broker, topic, partition, and consumer. Its simplicity and fault tolerance allow it to replace previous products like AMQP-based message queues.
  🔹 Pulsar
  Pulsar, developed originally by Yahoo, is an all-in-one messaging and streaming platform. Compared with Kafka, Pulsar incorporates many useful features from other products and supports a wide range of capabilities. Also, Pulsar architecture is more cloud-native, providing better support for cluster scaling and partition migration, etc.
  There are two layers in Pulsar architecture: the serving layer and the persistent layer. Pulsar natively supports tiered storage, where we can leverage cheaper object storage like AWS S3 to persist messages for a longer term.

- Top Eventual Consistency Patterns You Must Know
  Eventual consistency is a data consistency model that ensures that updates to a distributed database are eventually reflected across all nodes. Techniques like async replication help achieve eventual consistency.
  However, eventual consistency can also result in data inconsistency. Here are 4 patterns that can help you design applications.
  Pattern#1 - Event-based Eventual Consistency
  Services emit events and other services listen to these events to update their database instances. This makes services loosely coupled but delays data consistency.
  Pattern#2 - Background Sync Eventual Consistency
  In this pattern, a background job makes the data across databases consistent. It results in slower eventual consistency since the background job runs on a specific schedule.
  Pattern#3 - Saga-based Eventual Consistency
  Saga is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data with a single service. It is used to manage long-lived transactions that are eventually consistent.
  Pattern#4 - CQRS-based Eventual Consistency
  Separate read and write operations into different databases that are eventually consistent. Read and write models can be optimized for specific requirements.
  Over to you: Which other eventual consistency patterns have you seen?
