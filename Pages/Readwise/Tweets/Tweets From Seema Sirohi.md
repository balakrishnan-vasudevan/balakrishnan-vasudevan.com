## Highlights
- Saw a copy of the said "memo". Let's just say it doesn't pass the smell test. First, the language & grammar are too poor to meet basic IFS standard. Elitist or not but I have covered the MEA for a bit - 30 yrs to be precise. I know how they write. 1/4 https://t.co/LLgH2MnuuG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/seemasirohi/status/1734404694095642829))
