## Highlights
- If you are not highly senior, you won't get asked system design or open ended questions about industry best practices. This style of interviews are also about being able to discuss pros/cons. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1058439131481595905))
- This is my favorite git alias:
  undo = reset HEAD~

- I’ve done over 1000 (mostly API design) reviews when I was working on Go. You might be wondering who needs generics, here are my three categories:
  - Data layers, database APIs
  - Collections
  - Container types
  Lack of generics is not just copy/paste but causing error-prone APIs. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1273292758468276230))
- People keep asking me career advice, here is one:
  Make state someone else's problem. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1262599727394074626))
- What tools do you use to schedule and verify your database backups unless you are using a managed service that provides this feature out of the box? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1260694951324643329))
- The goal was to abstract away the infrastructure. We instead converted every application developer into an infrastructure developer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1254488061636866048))
- My draft on "Things I wished developers knew about databases" is 80% complete. For the first time, I'm going to publish more than 15 articles in an article. https://t.co/eIgUcJdEJK

- Hypervisors are L3, Kubernetes is L4 of cloud computing. If you only have L7 problems, obviously these are not the abstractions you are looking for. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1248084540599357440))
- Every practitioner should watch Gil Tene's "How NOT to Measure Latency". This talk have been a core reference that I couldn't stop resharing for many years. https://t.co/QRQrZY5ZV8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1247691691852623872))
- We (infrastructure folks) get credit by the lack of noise about our products/projects. Good infra just works and you can't tell it is there unless there is an outage. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1245812906756698114))
- Today’s fashion is one of a kind. https://t.co/aTHh6TQ3ju

- I wonder in what other profession that pays 6-7 figures, the hiring criteria is none of your accomplishments or experience but your performance in five whiteboard interviews. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1228423140138553344))
- @copyconstruct Docker: Completely changed the landscape from schedulers to tooling.
  Go: Changed the perspection statically typed languages cannot be lightweight, and their builds have to be slow, complex and expensive. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1208177871220404224))
- When I was studying software engineering practices, they explained us a ton of practices but missed the most crucial thing: How power dynamics work in large projects.
  Today I can almost claim you don’t understand software eng if you don’t know how power dynamics work. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1201395053697978368))
