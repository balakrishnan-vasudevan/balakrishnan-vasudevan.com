## Highlights
- Relational databases and key-values noSQL databases make up 85% of the market.
  But for some systems, it's more effective using specialized storages like:
  1. time series
  2. blob storages
  3. graph databases
  4. spatial databases
  How and why are they used ?

- Counting the number of digits in an integer is handy in many problems.
  Here 3 different methods based on:
  1. simple math 
  2. logarithms
  3. strings
  Do you know more pythonic ways ? https://t.co/bFOOiV9wjk

- There are 3 desirable properties for any distributed system:
  1. Consistency
  2. Availability
  3. Partition tolerance
  The CAP theorem states that only 2 out of the 3 are achievable.
  What are these properties ?
  Which are the possible combinations ?

- 🐍 Python: lambdas 🐍
  Lambdas are anonymous functions returning data
  ➤ syntax is lambda parameters : expression
  ➤ parameters shall be comma separated
  ➤ expression generate the returned data
  ➤ can be used as function arguments
  ➤ can be assigned to variables

- 🐍 Python: map 🐍
  Apply a function to items of an iterable
  ➤ the synthax is map(function, iterable, ...)
  ➤ function is commonly passed as a lambda
  ➤ multiple iterables can be passed as inputs
  ➤ returns a map object usable to create a list, set, ...

- Availability is critical for distributed systems.
  A downtime of 1 hour:
  • costs from $1K to $1M.
  • affect the system credibility
  • decrease the customers trust
  Here's how you can get a system available.
