## Highlights
- The problem I was given was to design a “Distributed Task Scheduler”. This is a common system design problem and I tried to narrow down the scope. However, for every assumption I made, I was pushed back that this is not the question and that I am overcomplicating the problem. Also, I proposed a simple design which I wanted to elaborate on but he said this wouldn’t support millions of tasks and users. When I told him that I would iterate over it, he asked me to come up with the final design instead! He was visibly impatient when I was trying to clarify the requirements for API design and at one point asked me to assume it's a simple API where a task is submitted and there was no clarification required!
- First, I was supposed to discuss a project that I had led in the past in technical depth. Based on my conversation with the recruiter, I prepared a document to discuss the project. However, when I asked him if I can present the document, he outright refused and said, “I expect you to be able to explain your project without any documents or diagrams!”. I explained my project, however, he seemed unimpressed. At one point he said, “What did you learn in all this?” The framing of the question was off, but the tone was worse.
- The most difficult situation I faced as a manager.
- The second screening interview was with a Senior Engineering Manager on the people management aspects. This was a 45-minute. A few of the questions/topics covered were:
- Feedback for improvement I received as a manager.
- A time when “I had to fire someone”.
- What are the things I consider while hiring someone?
- How do I ensure the growth of the people within my team?
