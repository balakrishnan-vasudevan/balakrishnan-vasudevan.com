## Highlights
- Linked List
  Dynamic array, implemented with a ring buffer (use a statically sized array underneath the hood)
  Hash set
  Hash map (with chaining)
  Binary heap (without decrease-key; know that Fibonacci heaps exist and know their guarantees)
  Binary search tree (doesn’t need to be self-balancing; know that self-balancing trees exist and know their guarantees)
  Prefix tree (a.k.a. trie)
  Suffix tree (don’t worry about compression, just build a dumb version; know that Ukkonen’s algorithm exists and learn its guarantees)
  An object-oriented adjacency list for graphs ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/734282688/10869268))
- Binary search (implement it both iteratively and recursively)
  Randomized quicksort (pay extra attention to the partition subroutine, as it’s useful in a lot of places)
  Mergesort
  Breadth-first search in a graph
  Depth-first search in a graph (augment it to detect cycles)
  Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
  Topological sort (using Tarjan’s algorithm)
  Dijkstra’s algorithm (without decrease-key)
  Longest common subsequence (using dynamic programming with matrices)
  Knapsack problem (also dynamic programming) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/734282688/10869269))
- Learn the basics of bit manipulation. Be able to explain what AND, OR, and XOR do. Know what a signed integer is. Know that there are 8 bits in a byte. Know what assembly is (from a high level), and get a sense of the basic operations that hardware exposes. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/734282688/10869270))
