## Highlights
- Specifically, our goals were to be able to:
- Upgrade incrementally so that we get feedback and learn lessons as soon as we can.
- Upgrade often so that the delta between our version and the upgraded version is as small as possible.
- Test upgrades so that we can precisely measure the performance impact of upgrades and make informed decisions about upgrade paths using this data.
