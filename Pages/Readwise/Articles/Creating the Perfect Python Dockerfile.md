## Highlights
- Turns out, Alpine might be small but in some cases, it can slow things down quite a bit due to some of the equivalent libraries that are used.
- That led me to believe that the biggest factor wasnâ€™t the operating system but how python was compiled. After some research, I found this issue that seems to validate that reasoning.
