| Title | Category | Environment | What Happened | Diagnosis Steps | Root Cause | Fix/Workaround | Lessons Learned | How to Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zombie Pods Causing NodeDrain to Hang | Cluster Management | K8s v1.23, On-prem bare metal, Systemd cgroups | A pod with a custom finalizer never completed termination, blocking kubectl drain. Even after the pod was marked for deletion, the API server kept waiting because the finalizer wasn’t removed. | Checked kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide to find lingering pods.<br> • Found pod stuck in Terminating state for over 20 minutes.<br> • Used kubectl describe pod <pod> to identify the presence of a custom finalizer.<br> • Investigated controller logs managing the finalizer – the controller had crashed. | Finalizer logic was never executed because its controller was down, leaving the pod undeletable. | kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge | Finalizers should have timeout or fail-safe logic. | Avoid finalizers unless absolutely necessary.<br> • Add monitoring for stuck Terminating pods.<br> • Implement retry/timeout logic in finalizer controllers. |
| API Server Crash Due to Excessive CRD Writes | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, GKE, heavy use of custom controllers | A bug in a controller created thousands of Custom Resources (CRs) in a tight reconciliation loop. Etcd was flooded, leading to slow writes, and the API server eventually became non-responsive. | API latency increased, leading to 504 Gateway Timeout errors in kubectl.<br> • Used kubectl get crds \| wc -l to list all CRs.<br> • Analyzed controller logs – found infinite reconcile on a specific CR type.<br> • etcd disk I/O was maxed. | Bad logic in reconcile loop: create was always called regardless of the state, creating resource floods. | Scaled the controller to 0 replicas.<br> • Manually deleted thousands of stale CRs using batch deletion. | Always test reconcile logic in a sandboxed cluster. | Implement create/update guards in reconciliation.<br> • Add Prometheus alert for high CR count. |
| Node Not Rejoining After Reboot | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21, Self-managed cluster, Static nodes | After a kernel upgrade and reboot, a node didn’t appear in kubectl get nodes. The kubelet logs showed registration issues. | Checked system logs and kubelet logs.<br> • Noticed --hostname-override didn't match the node name registered earlier.<br> • kubectl get nodes -o wide showed old hostname; new one mismatched due to DHCP/hostname change. | Kubelet registered with a hostname that no longer matched its node identity in the cluster. | Re-joined the node using correct --hostname-override.<br> • Cleaned up stale node entry from the cluster. | Node identity must remain consistent across reboots. | Set static hostnames and IPs.<br> • Use consistent cloud-init or kubeadm configuration. |
| Etcd Disk Full Causing API Server Timeout | Cluster Management | K8s v1.25, Bare-metal cluster | The cluster started failing API requests. Etcd logs showed disk space errors, and API server logs showed failed storage operations. | Used df -h on etcd nodes — confirmed disk full.<br> • Reviewed /var/lib/etcd – excessive WAL and snapshot files.<br> • Used etcdctl to assess DB size. | Lack of compaction and snapshotting caused disk to fill up with historical revisions and WALs. | bash<br>CopyEdit<br>etcdctl compact <rev><br>etcdctl defrag<br> • Cleaned logs, snapshots, and increased disk space temporarily. | etcd requires periodic maintenance. | Enable automatic compaction.<br> • Monitor disk space usage of etcd volumes. |
| Misconfigured Taints Blocking Pod Scheduling | Cluster Management | K8s v1.26, Multi-tenant cluster | A user added taints (NoSchedule) to all nodes to isolate their app, but forgot to include tolerations in workloads. Other apps stopped working. | Pods stuck in Pending state.<br> • Used kubectl describe pod <pod> – reason: no nodes match tolerations.<br> • Inspected node taints via kubectl describe node. | Lack of required tolerations on most workloads. | Removed the inappropriate taints.<br> • Re-scheduled workloads. | Node taints must be reviewed cluster-wide. | Educate teams on node taints and tolerations.<br> • Restrict RBAC for node mutation. |
| Kubelet DiskPressure Loop on Large Image Pulls | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, EKS | A new container image with many layers was deployed. Node’s disk filled up, triggering kubelet’s DiskPressure condition. Evicted pods created a loop. | Checked node conditions: kubectl describe node showed DiskPressure: True.<br> • Monitored image cache with crictl images.<br> • Node /var/lib/containerd usage exceeded threshold. | Excessive layering in container image and high pull churn caused disk exhaustion. | Rebuilt image using multistage builds and removed unused layers.<br> • Increased ephemeral disk space temporarily. | Container image size directly affects node stability. | Set resource requests/limits appropriately.<br> • Use image scanning to reject bloated images. |
| Node Goes NotReady Due to Clock Skew | Cluster Management | K8s v1.20, On-prem | TLS handshakes between the API server and a node started failing. Node became NotReady. Investigation showed NTP daemon was down. | Checked logs for TLS errors: “certificate expired or not yet valid”.<br> • Used timedatectl to check drift – node was 45s behind.<br> • NTP service was inactive. | Large clock skew between node and control plane led to invalid TLS sessions. | Restarted NTP sync.<br> • Restarted kubelet after sync. | Clock sync is critical in TLS-based distributed systems. | Use chronyd or systemd-timesyncd.<br> • Monitor clock skew across nodes. |
| API Server High Latency Due to Event Flooding | Cluster Management | K8s v1.23, Azure AKS | A custom controller logged frequent events (~50/second), causing the etcd event store to choke. | Prometheus showed spike in event count.<br> • kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp showed massive spam.<br> • Found misbehaving controller repeating failure events. | No rate limiting on event creation in controller logic. | Patched controller to rate-limit record.Eventf.<br> • Cleaned old events. | Events are not free – they impact etcd/API server. | Use deduplicated or summarized event logic.<br> • Set API server --event-ttl=1h and --eventRateLimit. |
| CoreDNS CrashLoop on Startup | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, DigitalOcean | A team added a custom rewrite rule in the Corefile which had invalid syntax. CoreDNS failed to start. | Checked logs: syntax error on startup.<br> • Used kubectl describe configmap coredns -n kube-system to inspect.<br> • Reproduced issue in test cluster. | Corefile misconfigured – incorrect directive placement. | Reverted to backup configmap.<br> • Restarted CoreDNS. | DNS misconfigurations can cascade quickly. | Use a CoreDNS validator before applying config.<br> • Maintain versioned backups of Corefile. |
| Control Plane Unavailable After Flannel Misconfiguration | Cluster Management | K8s v1.18, On-prem, Flannel CNI | A new node was added with a different pod CIDR than what Flannel expected. This broke pod-to-pod and node-to-control-plane communication. | kubectl timed out from nodes.<br> • Logs showed dropped traffic in iptables.<br> • Compared --pod-cidr in kubelet and Flannel config. | Pod CIDRs weren’t consistent across node and Flannel. | Reconfigured node with proper CIDR range.<br> • Flushed iptables and restarted Flannel. | CNI requires strict configuration consistency. | Enforce CIDR policy via admission control.<br> • Validate podCIDR ranges before adding new nodes. |
| kube-proxy IPTables Rules Overlap Breaking Networking | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, On-prem with kube-proxy in IPTables mode | A system admin added custom IPTables NAT rules for external routing, which inadvertently modified the same chains managed by kube-proxy. | DNS and service access failing intermittently.<br> • Ran iptables-save \| grep KUBE- – found modified chains.<br> • Checked kube-proxy logs: warnings about rule insert failures. | Manual IPTables rules conflicted with KUBE-SERVICES chains, causing rule precedence issues. | Flushed custom rules and reloaded kube-proxy.<br><br>bash<br>CopyEdit<br>iptables -F; systemctl restart kube-proxy | Never mix manual IPTables rules with kube-proxy-managed chains. | Use separate IPTables chains or policy routing.<br> • Document any node-level firewall rules clearly. |
| Stuck CSR Requests Blocking New Node Joins | Cluster Management | K8s v1.20, kubeadm cluster | A spike in expired certificate renewals caused hundreds of CSRs to queue, none of which were being auto-approved. New nodes waited indefinitely. | Ran kubectl get csr – saw >500 pending requests.<br> • New nodes stuck at kubelet: “waiting for server signing”.<br> • Approval controller was disabled due to misconfiguration. | Auto-approval for CSRs was turned off during a security patch, but not re-enabled. | bash<br>CopyEdit<br>kubectl certificate approve <csr-name><br> • Re-enabled the CSR approver controller. | CSR management is critical for kubelet-node communication. | Monitor pending CSRs.<br> • Don’t disable kube-controller-manager flags like --cluster-signing-cert-file. |
| Failed Cluster Upgrade Due to Unready Static Pods | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21 → v1.23 upgrade, kubeadm | During upgrade, etcd didn’t come up because its pod manifest had a typo. Kubelet never started etcd, causing control plane install to hang. | Checked /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml for errors.<br> • Used journalctl -u kubelet to see static pod startup errors.<br> • Verified pod not running via crictl ps. | Human error editing the static pod manifest – invalid volumeMount path. | Fixed manifest.<br> • Restarted kubelet to load corrected pod. | Static pods need strict validation. | Use YAML linter on static manifests.<br> • Backup manifests before upgrade. |
| Uncontrolled Logs Filled Disk on All Nodes | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, AWS EKS, containerd | A debug flag was accidentally enabled in a backend pod, logging hundreds of lines/sec. The journald and container logs filled up all disk space. | df -h showed /var/log full.<br> • Checked /var/log/containers/ – massive logs for one pod.<br> • Used kubectl logs to confirm excessive output. | A log level misconfiguration caused explosive growth in logs. | Rotated and truncated logs.<br> • Restarted container runtime after cleanup.<br> • Disabled debug logging. | Logging should be controlled and bounded. | Set log rotation policies for container runtimes.<br> • Enforce sane log levels via CI/CD validation. |
| Node Drain Fails Due to PodDisruptionBudget Deadlock | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21, production cluster with HPA and PDB | A deployment had minAvailable: 2 in PDB, but only 2 pods were running. Node drain couldn’t evict either pod without violating PDB. | Ran kubectl describe pdb <name> – saw AllowedDisruptions: 0.<br> • Checked deployment and replica count.<br> • Tried drain – stuck on pod eviction for 10+ minutes. | PDB guarantees clashed with under-scaled deployment. | Temporarily edited PDB to reduce minAvailable.<br> • Scaled up replicas before drain. | PDBs require careful coordination with replica count. | Validate PDBs during deployment scale-downs.<br> • Create alerts for PDB blocking evictions. |
| CrashLoop of Kube-Controller-Manager on Boot | Cluster Management | K8s v1.23, self-hosted control plane | After an upgrade, the --enable-admission-plugins flag included a deprecated plugin, causing crash. | Checked pod logs in /var/log/pods/.<br> • Saw panic error: “unknown admission plugin”.<br> • Compared plugin list with K8s documentation. | Version mismatch between config and actual controller-manager binary. | Removed the deprecated plugin from startup flags.<br> • Restarted pod. | Admission plugin deprecations are silent but fatal. | Track deprecations in each Kubernetes version.<br> • Automate validation of startup flags. |
| Inconsistent Cluster State After Partial Backup Restore | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, Velero-based etcd backup | etcd snapshot was restored, but PVCs and secrets weren’t included. Many pods failed to mount or pull secrets. | Pods failed with “volume not found” and “secret missing”.<br> • kubectl get pvc --all-namespaces returned empty.<br> • Compared resource counts pre- and post-restore. | Restore did not include volume snapshots or Kubernetes secrets, leading to an incomplete object graph. | Manually recreated PVCs and secrets using backups from another tool.<br> • Redeployed apps. | etcd backup is not enough alone. | Use backup tools that support volume + etcd (e.g., Velero with restic).<br> • Periodically test full cluster restores. |
| kubelet Unable to Pull Images Due to Proxy Misconfig | Cluster Management | K8s v1.25, Corporate proxy network | New kubelet config missed NO_PROXY=10.0.0.0/8,kubernetes.default.svc, causing internal DNS failures and image pull errors. | kubectl describe pod showed ImagePullBackOff.<br> • Checked environment variables for kubelet via systemctl show kubelet.<br> • Verified lack of NO_PROXY. | Proxy config caused kubelet to route internal cluster DNS and registry traffic through the proxy. | Updated kubelet service file to include proper NO_PROXY.<br> • Restarted kubelet. | Proxies in K8s require deep planning. | Always set NO_PROXY with service CIDRs and cluster domains.<br> • Test image pulls with isolated nodes first. |
| Multiple Nodes Marked Unreachable Due to Flaky Network Interface | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, Bare-metal, bonded NICs | A network switch port had flapping issues, leading to periodic loss of node heartbeats. | Node status flapped between Ready and NotReady.<br> • Checked NIC logs via dmesg and ethtool.<br> • Observed link flaps in switch logs. | Hardware or cable issue causing loss of connectivity. | Replaced cable and switch port.<br> • Set up redundant bonding with failover. | Physical layer issues can appear as node flakiness. | Monitor NIC link status and configure bonding.<br> • Proactively audit switch port health. |
| Node Labels Accidentally Overwritten by DaemonSet | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, DaemonSet-based node config | A platform team deployed a DaemonSet that set node labels like zone=us-east, but it overwrote custom labels like gpu=true. | Pods no longer scheduled to GPU nodes.<br> • kubectl get nodes --show-labels showed gpu label missing.<br> • Checked DaemonSet script – labels were overwritten, not merged. | Label management script used kubectl label node <node> key=value --overwrite, removing other labels. | Restored original labels from backup.<br> • Updated script to merge labels. | Node labels are critical for scheduling decisions. | Use label merging logic (e.g., fetch current labels, then patch).<br> • Protect key node labels via admission controllers. |
| Cluster Autoscaler Continuously Spawning and Deleting Nodes | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, AWS EKS with Cluster Autoscaler | A misconfigured deployment had a readiness probe that failed intermittently, making pods seem unready. Cluster Autoscaler detected these as unschedulable, triggering new node provisioning. Once the pod appeared healthy again, Autoscaler would scale down. | Monitored Cluster Autoscaler logs (kubectl -n kube-system logs -l app=cluster-autoscaler).<br> • Identified repeated scale-up and scale-down messages.<br> • Traced back to a specific deployment’s readiness probe. | Flaky readiness probe created false unschedulable pods. | Fixed the readiness probe to accurately reflect pod health.<br> • Tuned scale-down-delay-after-add and scale-down-unneeded-time settings. | Readiness probes directly impact Autoscaler decisions. | Validate all probes before production deployments.<br> • Use Autoscaler logging to audit scaling activity. |
| Stale Finalizers Preventing Namespace Deletion | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21, self-managed | The namespace contained resources with finalizers pointing to a deleted controller. Kubernetes waited forever for the finalizer to complete cleanup. | Ran kubectl get ns <name> -o json – saw dangling finalizers.<br> • Checked for the corresponding CRD/controller – it was uninstalled. | Finalizers without owning controller cause resource lifecycle deadlocks. | Manually removed finalizers using a patched JSON:<br><br>bash<br>CopyEdit<br>kubectl patch ns <name> -p '{"spec":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge | Always delete CRs before removing the CRD or controller. | Implement controller cleanup logic.<br> • Audit finalizers periodically. |
| CoreDNS CrashLoop Due to Invalid ConfigMap Update | Cluster Management | K8s v1.23, managed GKE | A platform engineer edited the CoreDNS ConfigMap to add a rewrite rule, but introduced a syntax error. The new pods started crashing, and DNS resolution stopped working across the cluster. | Ran kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns – saw config parse errors.<br> • Used kubectl describe pod to confirm CrashLoopBackOff.<br> • Validated config against CoreDNS docs. | Invalid configuration line in CoreDNS ConfigMap. | Rolled back to previous working ConfigMap.<br> • Restarted CoreDNS pods to pick up change. | ConfigMap changes can instantly affect cluster-wide services. | Use coredns -conf <file> locally to validate changes.<br> • Test changes in a non-prod namespace before rollout. |
| Pod Eviction Storm Due to DiskPressure | Cluster Management | K8s v1.25, self-managed, containerd | A nightly batch job triggered a container image update across thousands of pods. Pulling these images used all available space in /var/lib/containerd, which led to node condition DiskPressure, forcing eviction of critical workloads. | Used kubectl describe node – found DiskPressure=True.<br> • Inspected /var/lib/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs/.<br> • Checked image pull logs. | No image GC and too many simultaneous pulls filled up disk space. | Pruned unused images.<br> • Enabled container runtime garbage collection. | DiskPressure can take down entire nodes without warning. | Set eviction thresholds properly in kubelet.<br> • Enforce rolling update limits (maxUnavailable). |
| Orphaned PVs Causing Unscheduled Pods | Cluster Management | K8s v1.20, CSI storage on vSphere | After pod deletion, PVs went into Released state but were never cleaned up due to missing ReclaimPolicy logic. When new PVCs requested the same storage class, provisioning failed. | Ran kubectl get pvc – saw Pending PVCs.<br> • kubectl get pv – old PVs stuck in Released.<br> • CSI driver logs showed volume claim conflicts. | ReclaimPolicy set to Retain and no manual cleanup. | Manually deleted orphaned PVs.<br> • Changed ReclaimPolicy to Delete for similar volumes. | PV lifecycle must be actively monitored. | Add cleanup logic in storage lifecycle.<br> • Implement PV alerts based on state. |
| Taints and Tolerations Mismatch Prevented Workload Scheduling | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, managed AKS | Platform team added a new node pool with node-role.kubernetes.io/gpu:NoSchedule, but forgot to add tolerations to GPU workloads. | kubectl describe pod – showed reason: “0/3 nodes are available: node(s) had taints”.<br> • Checked node taints via kubectl get nodes -o json. | Taints on new node pool weren’t matched by tolerations in pods. | Added proper tolerations to workloads:<br><br>yaml<br>CopyEdit<br>tolerations:<br>- key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/gpu"<br> operator: "Exists"<br> effect: "NoSchedule" | Node taints should be coordinated with scheduling policies. | Use preset toleration templates in CI/CD pipelines.<br> • Test new node pools with dummy workloads. |
| Node Bootstrap Failure Due to Unavailable Container Registry | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21, on-prem, private registry | The internal Docker registry was down during node provisioning, so containerd couldn't pull pauseand CNI images. Nodes stayed in NotReady state. | journalctl -u containerd – repeated image pull failures.<br> • Node conditions showed ContainerRuntimeNotReady. | Bootstrap process relies on image pulls from unavailable registry. | Brought internal registry back online.<br> • Pre-pulled pause/CNI images to node image templates. | Registry availability is a bootstrap dependency. | Preload all essential images into AMI/base image.<br> • Monitor registry uptime independently. |
| kubelet Fails to Start Due to Expired TLS Certs | Cluster Management | K8s v1.19, kubeadm cluster | Kubelet uses a client certificate for authentication with the API server. These are typically auto-rotated, but the nodes were offline when the rotation was due. | journalctl -u kubelet – cert expired error.<br> • /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem – expired date. | Kubelet cert rotation missed due to node downtime. | Regenerated kubelet certs using kubeadm.<br><br>bash<br>CopyEdit<br>kubeadm certs renew all | Cert rotation has a dependency on uptime. | Monitor cert expiry proactively.<br> • Rotate certs manually before planned outages. |
| kube-scheduler Crash Due to Invalid Leader Election Config | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, custom scheduler deployment | An override in the Helm chart introduced an invalid leader election namespace, causing the scheduler to panic and crash on startup. | Pod logs showed panic: cannot create leader election record.<br> • Checked Helm values – found wrong namespace name. | Namespace specified for leader election did not exist. | Created the missing namespace.<br> • Restarted the scheduler pod. | Leader election is sensitive to namespace scoping. | Use default kube-system unless explicitly scoped.<br> • Validate all scheduler configs with CI linting. |
| Cluster DNS Resolution Broken After Calico CNI Update | Cluster Management | K8s v1.23, self-hosted Calico | New version of Calico enforced stricter iptables drop policies, blocking traffic from CoreDNS to pods. | DNS requests timed out.<br> • Packet capture showed ICMP unreachable from pods to CoreDNS.<br> • Checked Calico policy and iptables rules. | Calico’s default deny policy applied to kube-dns traffic. | Added explicit Calico policy allowing kube-dns to pod traffic.<br><br>yaml:<br>egress:<br>- action: Allow<br> destination:<br> selector: "k8s-app == 'kube-dns'" | CNI policy changes can impact DNS without warning. | Review and test all network policy upgrades in staging.<br> • Use canary upgrade strategy for CNI. |
| Node Clock Drift Causing Authentication Failures | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, on-prem, kubeadm | Token-based authentication failed for all workloads and kubectl access due to time drift between worker nodes and the API server. | Ran kubectl logs and found expired token errors.<br> • Checked node time using date on each node – found significant drift.<br> • Verified NTP daemon status – not running. | NTP daemon disabled on worker nodes. | Re-enabled and restarted NTP on all nodes.<br> • Synchronized system clocks manually. | Time synchronization is critical for certificate and token-based auth. | Ensure NTP or chrony is enabled via bootstrap configuration.<br> • Monitor time drift via node-exporter. |
| Inconsistent Node Labels Causing Scheduling Bugs | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, multi-zone GKE | Pods using topologySpreadConstraints for zone balancing failed to find valid nodes because some nodes lacked the topology.kubernetes.io/zone label. | Pod events showed no matching topology key errors.<br> • Compared node labels across zones – found inconsistency. | A few nodes were manually added without required zone labels. | Manually patched node labels to restore zone metadata. | Label uniformity is essential for topology constraints. | Automate label injection using cloud-init or DaemonSet.<br> • Add CI checks for required labels on node join. |
| API Server Slowdowns from High Watch Connection Count | Cluster Management | K8s v1.23, OpenShift | Multiple pods opened persistent watch connections and never closed them, overloading the API server. | Monitored API metrics /metrics for apiserver_registered_watchers.<br> • Identified top offenders using connection source IPs. | Custom controller with poor watch logic never closed connections. | Restarted offending pods.<br> • Updated controller to reuse watches. | Unbounded watches can exhaust server resources. | Use client-go with resync periods and connection limits.<br> • Enable metrics to detect watch leaks early. |
| Etcd Disk Full Crashing the Cluster | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21, self-managed with local etcd | Continuous writes from custom resources filled the disk where etcd data was stored. | Observed etcdserver: mvcc: database space exceeded errors.<br> • Checked disk usage: df -h showed 100% full. | No compaction or defragmentation done on etcd for weeks. | Performed etcd compaction and defragmentation.<br> • Added disk space temporarily. | Etcd needs regular maintenance. | Set up cron jobs or alerts for etcd health.<br> • Monitor disk usage and trigger auto-compaction. |
| ClusterConfigMap Deleted by Accident Bringing Down Addons | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, Rancher | Pods mounting the kube-root-ca.crt ConfigMap failed to start after deletion. DNS, metrics-server, and other system components failed. | Pod events showed missing ConfigMap errors.<br> • Attempted to remount volumes manually. | System-critical ConfigMap was deleted without RBAC protections. | Recreated ConfigMap from backup.<br> • Re-deployed affected system workloads. | Some ConfigMaps are essential and must be protected. | Add RBAC restrictions to system namespaces.<br> • Use OPA/Gatekeeper to prevent deletions of protected resources. |
| Misconfigured NodeAffinity Excluding All Nodes | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, Azure AKS | nodeAffinity required a zone that did not exist in the cluster, making all nodes invalid. | Pod events showed 0/10 nodes available errors.<br> • Checked spec.affinity section in deployment YAML. | Invalid or overly strict requiredDuringScheduling nodeAffinity. | Updated deployment YAML to reflect actual zones.<br> • Re-deployed workloads. | nodeAffinity is strict and should be used carefully. | Validate node labels before setting affinity.<br> • Use preferredDuringScheduling for soft constraints. |
| Outdated Admission Webhook Blocking All Deployments | Cluster Management | K8s v1.25, self-hosted | The admission webhook had expired TLS certs, causing validation errors on all resource creation attempts. | Created a dummy pod and observed webhook errors.<br> • Checked logs of the webhook pod – found TLS handshake failures. | Webhook server was down due to expired TLS cert. | Renewed cert and redeployed webhook.<br> • Disabled webhook temporarily for emergency deployments. | Webhooks are gatekeepers – they must be monitored. | Rotate webhook certs using cert-manager.<br> • Alert on webhook downtime or errors. |
| API Server Certificate Expiry Blocking Cluster Access | Cluster Management | K8s v1.19, kubeadm | Default kubeadm cert rotation didn’t occur, leading to expiry of API server and etcd peer certs. | kubectl failed with x509: certificate has expired.<br> • Checked /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt expiry date. | kubeadm certificates were never rotated or renewed. | Used kubeadm certs renew all.<br> • Restarted control plane components. | Certificates expire silently unless monitored. | Rotate certs before expiry.<br> • Monitor /metrics for cert validity. |
| CRI Socket Mismatch Preventing kubelet Startup | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, containerd switch | The node image had containerd installed, but the kubelet still pointed to the Docker socket. | Checked kubelet logs for failed to connect to CRI socket.<br> • Verified config file at /var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env. | Wrong --container-runtime-endpoint specified. | Updated kubelet flags to point to /run/containerd/containerd.sock.<br> • Restarted kubelet. | CRI migration requires explicit config updates. | Use migration scripts or kubeadm migration guides.<br> • Validate container runtime on node bootstrap. |
| Cluster-Wide Crash Due to Misconfigured Resource Quotas | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, multi-tenant namespace setup | A new quota was applied with very low CPU/memory limits. All new pods across namespaces failed scheduling. | Pod events showed failed quota check errors.<br> • Checked quota via kubectl describe quota in all namespaces. | Misconfigured CPU/memory limits set globally. | Rolled back the quota to previous values.<br> • Unblocked critical namespaces manually. | Quota changes should be staged and validated. | Test new quotas in shadow or dry-run mode.<br> • Use automated checks before applying quotas. |
| Cluster Upgrade Failing Due to CNI Compatibility | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21 to v1.22, custom CNI plugin | After upgrading the control plane, CNI plugins failed to work, resulting in no network connectivity between pods. | Checked kubelet and container runtime logs – observed CNI errors.<br> • Verified CNI plugin version – it was incompatible with K8s v1.22. | CNI plugin was not upgraded alongside the Kubernetes control plane. | Upgraded the CNI plugin to the version compatible with K8s v1.22.<br> • Restarted affected pods and nodes. | Always ensure compatibility between the Kubernetes version and CNI plugin. | Follow Kubernetes upgrade documentation and ensure CNI plugins are upgraded.<br> • Test in a staging environment before performing production upgrades. |
| Failed Pod Security Policy Enforcement Causing Privileged Container Launch | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, AWS EKS | A container was able to run as privileged despite a restrictive PodSecurityPolicy being in place. | Checked pod events and logs, found no violations of PodSecurityPolicy.<br> • Verified PodSecurityPolicy settings and namespace annotations. | PodSecurityPolicy was not enforced due to missing podsecuritypolicy admission controller. | Enabled the podsecuritypolicy admission controller.<br> • Updated the PodSecurityPolicy to restrict privileged containers. | Admission controllers must be properly configured for security policies to be enforced. | Double-check admission controller configurations during initial cluster setup.<br> • Regularly audit security policies and admission controllers. |
| Node Pool Scaling Impacting StatefulSets | Cluster Management | K8s v1.24, GKE | Node pool scaling in GKE triggered a rescheduling of StatefulSet pods, breaking persistent volume claims that were tied to specific nodes. | Observed failed to bind volume errors.<br> • Checked StatefulSet configuration for node affinity and volume binding policies. | Lack of proper node affinity or persistent volume binding policies in StatefulSet configuration. | Added proper node affinity rules and volume binding policies to StatefulSet.<br> • Rescheduled the pods successfully. | StatefulSets require careful management of node affinity and persistent volume binding policies. | Use pod affinity rules for StatefulSets to ensure proper scheduling and volume binding.<br> • Monitor volume binding status when scaling node pools. |
| Kubelet Crash Due to Out of Memory (OOM) Errors | Cluster Management | K8s v1.20, bare metal | The kubelet on a node crashed after the available memory was exhausted due to pods consuming more memory than allocated. | Checked kubelet logs for OOM errors.<br> • Used kubectl describe node to check resource utilization. | Pod resource requests and limits were not set properly, leading to excessive memory consumption. | Set proper resource requests and limits on pods to prevent memory over-consumption.<br> • Restarted the kubelet on the affected node. | Pod resource limits and requests are essential for proper node resource utilization. | Set reasonable resource requests and limits for all pods.<br> • Monitor node resource usage to catch resource overuse before it causes crashes. |
| DNS Resolution Failure in Multi-Cluster Setup | Cluster Management | K8s v1.23, multi-cluster federation | DNS queries failed between two federated clusters, preventing services from accessing each other across clusters. | Used kubectl get svc to check DNS records.<br> • Identified missing service entries in the DNS server configuration. | DNS configuration was incomplete, missing records for federated services. | Added missing DNS records manually.<br> • Updated DNS configurations to include service records for all federated clusters. | In multi-cluster setups, DNS configuration is critical to service discovery. | Automate DNS record creation during multi-cluster federation setup.<br> • Regularly audit DNS configurations in multi-cluster environments. |
| Insufficient Resource Limits in Autoscaling Setup | Cluster Management | K8s v1.21, GKE with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) | The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler failed to scale the application pods up, even under load, due to insufficient resource limits set on the pods. | Observed HPA metrics showing no scaling action.<br> • Checked pod resource requests and limits. | Resource limits were too low for HPA to trigger scaling actions. | Increased resource requests and limits for the affected pods.<br> • Manually scaled the pods and monitored the autoscaling behavior. | Proper resource limits are essential for autoscaling to function correctly. | Set adequate resource requests and limits for workloads managed by HPA.<br> • Monitor autoscaling events to identify under-scaling issues. |
| Control Plane Overload Due to High Audit Log Volume | Cluster Management | K8s v1.22, Azure AKS | A misconfigured audit policy led to high volumes of audit logs being generated, overwhelming the control plane. | Monitored control plane metrics and found high CPU usage due to audit logs.<br> • Reviewed audit policy and found it was logging excessive data. | Overly broad audit log configuration captured too many events. | Refined audit policy to log only critical events.<br> • Restarted the API server. | Audit logging needs to be fine-tuned to prevent overload. | Regularly review and refine audit logging policies.<br> • Set alerts for high audit log volumes. |

| StatefulSet Volume Cloning Results in Data Leakage | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, CSI Volume Cloning enabled | Engineers used volume cloning to duplicate data for new pods. They assumed data would be copied and isolated. However, clones preserved file locks and session metadata, which caused apps to behave erratically. | New pods accessed old session data unexpectedly.<br> • lsblk and md5sum on cloned volumes showed identical data.<br> • Verified cloning was done via StorageClass that didn't support true snapshot isolation. | Misunderstanding of cloning behavior — logical clone ≠ deep copy. | Stopped cloning and switched to backup/restore-based provisioning.<br> • Used rsync with integrity checks instead. | Not all clones are deep copies; understand your CSI plugin's clone semantics. | Use cloning only for stateless data unless supported thoroughly.<br> • Validate cloned volume content before production use. |
| Volume Resize Not Reflected in Mounted Filesystem | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, OpenEBS | After increasing PVC size, the PV reflected the new size, but df -h inside the pod still showed the old size. | Checked PVC and PV: showed expanded size.<br> • Pod logs indicated no disk space.<br> • mount inside pod showed volume was mounted but not resized. | Filesystem resize not triggered automatically. | Restarted pod to remount the volume and trigger resize.<br> • Verified resize2fs logs in CSI driver. | Volume resizing may require pod restarts depending on CSI driver. | Schedule a rolling restart after volume resize operations.<br> • Check if your CSI driver supports online filesystem resizing. |
| CSI Controller Pod Crash Due to Log Overflow | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, Longhorn | A looped RPC error generated thousands of log lines per second.

| PVs Stuck in Released Due to Missing Finalizer Removal | Storage | Kubernetes v1.21, NFS | PVC deletion left behind PVs marked as Released, and the NFS driver didn’t remove finalizers, blocking clean-up. | Listed PVs: showed Released, with kubernetes.io/pv-protection finalizer still present.<br> • Couldn’t bind new PVCs due to status: Released. | Driver didn’t implement Delete reclaim logic properly. | Patched PVs to remove finalizers.<br> • Recycled or deleted volumes manually. | Some drivers require manual cleanup unless fully CSI-compliant. | Use CSI drivers with full lifecycle support.<br> • Monitor PV statuses regularly. |
| CSI Driver DaemonSet Deployment Missing Tolerations for Taints | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, Bare Metal | Storage nodes were tainted (node-role.kubernetes.io/storage:NoSchedule), and the CSI DaemonSet didn’t tolerate it, so pods failed to mount volumes. | CSI node pods not scheduled on certain nodes.<br> • Checked node taints vs DaemonSet tolerations.<br> • Pods stuck in Pending. | Taint/toleration mismatch in CSI node plugin manifest. | Added required tolerations to DaemonSet. | Storage plugins must tolerate relevant node taints to function correctly. | Review node taints and CSI tolerations during setup.<br> • Use node affinity and tolerations for critical system components. |
| Mount Propagation Issues with Sidecar Containers | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, GKE | An app container wrote to a mounted path, but sidecar container couldn’t read the changes. | Logs in sidecar showed empty directory.<br> • Checked volumeMounts: missing mountPropagation: Bidirectional. | Default mount propagation is None, blocking volume visibility between containers. | Added mountPropagation: Bidirectional to shared volumeMounts. | Without correct propagation, shared volumes don’t work across containers. | Understand container mount namespaces.<br> • Always define propagation when using shared mounts. |
| File Permissions Reset on Pod Restart | Storage | Kubernetes v1.20, CephFS | App wrote files with specific UID/GID. After restart, files were inaccessible due to CephFS resetting ownership. | Compared ls -l before/after restart.<br> • Storage class used fsGroup: 9999 by default. | PodSecurityContext didn't override fsGroup, so default applied every time. | Set explicit securityContext.fsGroup in pod spec. | CSI plugins may enforce ownership unless overridden. | Always declare expected ownership with securityContext. |
| Volume Mount Succeeds but Application Can't Write | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, EBS | App expected xfs but volume formatted as ext4. Some operations silently failed or corrupted. | Application logs showed invalid argument on file ops.<br> • CSI driver defaulted to ext4.<br> • Verified with df -T. | Application compatibility issue with default filesystem. | Used storage class parameter to specify xfs. | Filesystem types matter for certain workloads. | Align volume formatting with application expectations. |
| Volume Snapshot Restore Includes Corrupt Data | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, Velero + CSI Snapshots | Velero snapshot was taken during active write burst. Filesystem was inconsistent at time of snapshot. | App logs showed corrupted files after restore.<br> • Snapshot logs showed no quiescing.<br> • Restore replayed same state. | No pre-freeze or app-level quiescing before snapshot. | Paused writes before snapshot.<br> • Enabled filesystem freeze hook in Velero plugin. | Snapshots must be coordinated with app state. | Use pre/post hooks for consistent snapshotting. |
| Zombie Volumes Occupying Cloud Quota | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, AWS EBS | PVCs were deleted, but EBS volumes stayed in-use, blocking provisioning of new ones due to quota limits. | Checked AWS Console: volumes remained.<br> • Described events: detach errors during node crash. | CSI driver missed final detach due to abrupt node termination. | Manually detached and deleted volumes.<br> • Adjusted controller retry limits. | Cloud volumes may silently linger even after PVC/PV deletion. | Use cloud resource monitoring.<br> • Add alerts for orphaned volumes. |
| Volume Snapshot Garbage Collection Fails | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, CSI Snapshotter with Velero | Snapshots triggered via Velero remained in the cluster even after restore, eventually exhausting cloud snapshot limits and storage quota. | Listed all VolumeSnapshots and VolumeSnapshotContents — saw hundreds still in ReadyToUse: true state.<br> • Checked finalizers on snapshot objects — found snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/volumesnapshot not removed.<br> • Velero logs showed successful restore but no cleanup action. | Snapshot GC controller didn’t remove finalizers due to missing permissions in Velero's service account. | Added required RBAC rules to Velero.<br> • Manually deleted stale snapshot objects. | Improperly configured snapshot permissions can stall GC. | Always test snapshot and restore flows end-to-end.<br> • Enable automated cleanup in your backup tooling. |
| Volume Mount Delays Due to Node Drain Stale Attachment | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, AWS EBS CSI | After draining a node for maintenance, workloads failed over, but volume attachments still pointed to old node, causing delays in remount. | Described PV: still had attachedNode as drained one.<br> • Cloud logs showed volume in-use errors.<br> • CSI controller didn’t retry detach fast enough. | Controller had exponential backoff on detach retries. | Reduced backoff limit in CSI controller config.<br> • Used manual detach via cloud CLI in emergencies. | Volume operations can get stuck in edge-node cases. | Use health checks to ensure detach success before draining.<br> • Monitor VolumeAttachment objects during node ops. |
| Application Writes Lost After Node Reboot | Storage | Kubernetes v1.21, Local Persistent Volumes | Application data wasn’t persisted after a power cycle because the mount point dynamically changed. | Compared volume paths before and after reboot.<br> • Found PV had hostPath mount with no stable binding.<br> • Volume wasn’t pinned to specific disk partition. | Local PV was defined with generic hostPath, not using local volume plugin with device references. | Refactored PV to use local with nodeAffinity.<br> • Explicitly mounted disk partitions. | hostPath should not be used for production data. | Always use local storage plugin for node-local disks.<br> • Avoid loosely defined persistent paths. |
| Pod CrashLoop Due to Read-Only Volume Remount | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, GCP Filestore | During a brief NFS outage, volume was remounted in read-only mode by the NFS client. Application kept crashing due to inability to write logs. | Checked mount logs: showed NFS remounted as read-only.<br> • kubectl describe pod: showed volume still mounted.<br> • Pod logs: permission denied on write. | NFS client behavior defaults to remount as read-only after timeout. | Restarted pod to trigger clean remount.<br> • Tuned NFS mount options (soft, timeo, retry). | NFS remount behavior can silently switch access mode. | Monitor for dmesg or NFS client remounts.<br> • Add alerts for unexpected read-only volume transitions. |
| Data Corruption on Shared Volume With Two Pods | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, NFS PVC shared by 2 pods | Both pods ran jobs writing to the same output files. Without file locking, one pod overwrote data from the other. | Logs showed incomplete file writes.<br> • File hashes changed mid-run.<br> • No mutual exclusion mechanism implemented. | Shared volume used without locking or coordination between pods. | Refactored app logic to coordinate file writes via leader election.<br> • Used a queue-based processing system. | Shared volume access must be controlled explicitly. | Never assume coordination when using shared volumes.<br> • Use per-pod PVCs or job-level locking. |
| Mount Volume Exceeded Timeout | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, Azure Disk CSI | CSI node plugin had stale cache and attempted mount on incorrect device path. Retry logic delayed pod start by ~15 minutes. | Described pod: stuck with Unable to mount volume error.<br> • Node CSI logs: device not found.<br> • Saw old mount references in plugin cache. | Plugin did not invalidate mount state properly after a failed mount. | Cleared plugin cache manually.<br> • Upgraded CSI driver to fixed version. | CSI drivers can introduce delays through stale state. | Keep CSI drivers up-to-date.<br> • Use pre-mount checks to validate device paths. |
| Static PV Bound to Wrong PVC | Storage | Kubernetes v1.21, Manually created PVs | Two PVCs had overlapping selectors. The PV intended for app-A was bound to app-B, which accessed restricted files. | Checked PV annotations: saw wrong PVC UID.<br> • File system showed app-A data.<br> • Both PVCs used identical storageClassName and no selector. | Ambiguous PV selection caused unintended binding. | Used volumeName field in PVCs for direct binding.<br> • Set explicit labels/selectors to isolate. | Manual PVs require strict binding rules. | Use volumeName for static PV binding.<br> • Avoid reusing storageClassName across different apps. |
| Pod Eviction Due to DiskPressure Despite PVC | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, Local PVs | Node root disk filled up with log data, triggering eviction manager. The PVC itself was healthy and not full. | Node describe: showed DiskPressure condition true.<br> • Application pod evicted due to node pressure, not volume pressure.<br> • Root disk had full /var/log. | Kubelet doesn’t distinguish between root disk and attached volumes for eviction triggers. | Cleaned logs from root disk.<br> • Moved logging to PVC-backed location. | PVCs don’t protect from node-level disk pressure. | Monitor node root disks in addition to volume usage.<br> • Redirect logs and temp files to PVCs. |
| Pod Gets Stuck Due to Ghost Mount Point | Storage | Kubernetes v1.20, iSCSI volumes | After node crash, the iSCSI mount folder remained but device wasn’t attached. New pod couldn’t proceed due to leftover mount artifacts. | CSI logs: mount path exists but not a mount point.<br> • mount \| grep iscsi — returned nothing.<br> • ls /mnt/... — folder existed with empty contents. | Stale mount folder confused CSI plugin logic. | Manually deleted stale mount folders.<br> • Restarted kubelet on affected node. | Mount lifecycle must be cleanly managed. | Use pre-start hooks to validate mount point integrity.<br> • Include cleanup logic in custom CSI deployments. |
| PVC Resize Broke StatefulSet Ordering | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, StatefulSets + RWO PVCs | PVC expansion triggered pod restarts, but multiple pods came up simultaneously, causing database quorum failures. | Checked StatefulSet controller behavior — PVC resize didn’t preserve pod startup order.<br> • App logs: quorum could not be established. | StatefulSet controller didn’t serialize PVC resizes. | Manually controlled pod restarts during PVC resize.<br> • Added readiness gates to enforce sequential boot. | StatefulSets don't coordinate PVC changes well. | Use podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady.<br> • Handle resizes during maintenance windows. |
| ReadAfterWrite Inconsistency on Object Store-Backed CSI | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, MinIO CSI driver, Ceph RGW backend | A distributed app wrote metadata and then read it back to validate—however, the file content was outdated due to eventual consistency in object backend. | Logged file hashes before and after write — mismatch seen.<br> • Found underlying storage was S3-compatible with eventual consistency.<br> • CSI driver buffered writes asynchronously. | Object store semantics (eventual consistency) not suitable for synchronous read-after-write patterns. | Introduced write barriers and retry logic in app.<br> • Switched to CephFS for strong consistency. | Object store-backed volumes need strong consistency guards. | Avoid using S3-style backends for workloads expecting POSIX semantics.<br> • Use CephFS, NFS, or block storage for transactional I/O. |
| PV Resize Fails After Node Reboot | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, AWS EBS | VolumeExpansion was triggered via PVC patch. But after a node reboot, controller couldn't find the in-use mount point to complete fsResize. | PVC status.conditions showed FileSystemResizePending.<br> • CSI node plugin logs showed missing device.<br> • Node reboot removed mount references prematurely. | Resize operation depends on volume being mounted at the time of filesystem expansion. | Reattached volume by starting pod temporarily on the node.<br> • Resize completed automatically. | Filesystem resize requires node readiness and volume mount. | Schedule resizes during stable node windows.<br> • Use pvc-resize readiness gates in automation. |
| CSI Driver Crash Loops on VolumeAttach | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, OpenEBS Jiva CSI | VolumeAttachment object triggered a plugin bug—CSI crashed during RPC call, making storage class unusable. | Checked CSI node logs — Go panic in attach handler.<br> • Pods using Jiva SC failed with AttachVolume.Attach failed error.<br> • CSI pod restarted every few seconds. | Volume metadata had an unexpected field due to version mismatch. | Rolled back CSI driver to stable version.<br> • Purged corrupted volume metadata. | CSI versioning must be tightly managed. | Use upgrade staging before deploying new CSI versions.<br> • Enable CSI health monitoring via liveness probes. |
| PVC Binding Fails Due to Multiple Default StorageClasses | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23 | Two different teams installed their storage plugins (EBS and Rook), both marked default. PVC binding randomly chose one. | Ran kubectl get storageclass — two entries with is-default-class=true.<br> • PVCs had no storageClassName, leading to random binding.<br> • One SC used unsupported reclaimPolicy. | Multiple default StorageClasses confuse the scheduler. | Patched one SC to remove the default annotation.<br> • Explicitly specified SC in Helm charts. | Default SC conflicts silently break provisioning. | Enforce single default SC via cluster policy.<br> • Always specify storageClassName explicitly in critical apps. |
| Zombie VolumeAttachment Blocks New PVC | Storage | Kubernetes v1.21, Longhorn | Application tried to use the volume, but Longhorn saw the old attachment from a dead node and refused reattachment. | Listed VolumeAttachment resources — found one pointing to a non-existent node.<br> • Longhorn logs: volume already attached to another node.<br> • Node was removed forcefully. | VolumeAttachment controller did not clean up orphaned entries on node deletion. | Manually deleted VolumeAttachment.<br> • Restarted CSI pods to refresh state. | Controller garbage collection is fragile post-node failure. | Use node lifecycle hooks to detach volumes gracefully.<br> • Alert on dangling VolumeAttachments. |
| Persistent Volume Bound But Not Mounted | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, NFS | NFS server was unreachable during pod start. Pod started, but mount failed silently due to default retry behavior. | mount output lacked NFS entry.<br> • Pod logs: No such file or directory errors.<br> • CSI logs showed silent NFS timeout. | CSI driver didn’t fail pod start when mount failed. | Added mountOptions: [hard,intr] to NFS SC.<br> • Set pod readiness probe to check file existence. | Mount failures don’t always stop pod startup. | Validate mounts via init containers or probes.<br> • Monitor CSI logs on pod lifecycle events. |
| CSI Snapshot Restore Overwrites Active Data | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, CSI snapshots (v1beta1) | Snapshot restore process recreated PVC from source but didn't prevent overwriting an already-mounted volume. | Traced VolumeSnapshotContent and PVC references.<br> • PVC had reclaimPolicy: Retain, but was reused.<br> • SnapshotClass used Delete policy. | No validation existed between snapshot restore and in-use PVCs. | Restored snapshot to a new PVC and used manual copy/move.<br> • Added lifecycle checks before invoking restores. | Restoring snapshots can be destructive. | Never restore to in-use PVCs without backup.<br> • Build snapshot workflows that validate PVC state. |
| Incomplete Volume Detach Breaks Node Scheduling | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, iSCSI | Node marked as ready, but volume controller skipped scheduling new pods due to “in-use” flag on volumes from a deleted pod. | Described unscheduled pod — failed to bind due to volume already attached.<br> • VolumeAttachment still referenced old pod.<br> • CSI logs showed no detach command received. | CSI controller restart dropped detach request queue. | Recreated CSI controller pod.<br> • Requeued detach operation via manual deletion. | CSI recovery from mid-state crash is critical. | Persist attach/detach queues.<br> • Use cloud-level health checks for cleanup. |
| App Breaks Due to Missing SubPath After Volume Expansion | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, PVC with subPath | Application was configured to mount /data/subdir. After resizing, pod restarted, and subPath was ignored, mounting full volume at /data. | Pod logs showed missing directory structure.<br> • Inspected pod spec: subPath was correct.<br> • CSI logs: subPath expansion failed due to permissions. | CSI driver did not remap subPath after resize correctly. | Changed pod to recreate the subPath explicitly.<br> • Waited for bugfix release from CSI provider. | PVC expansion may break subPath unless handled explicitly. | Avoid complex subPath usage unless tested under all lifecycle events.<br> • Watch CSI release notes carefully. |
| Backup Restore Process Created Orphaned PVCs | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, Velero | Velero restored PVCs without matching spec.volumeName. Since PVs weren’t backed up, they remained Pending. | PVC status showed Pending, with no bound PV.<br> • Described PVC: no volumeName, no SC.<br> • Velero logs: skipped PV restore due to config. | Restore policy did not include PVs. | Recreated PVCs manually with correct storage class.<br> • Re-enabled PV backup in Velero settings. | Partial restores break PVC-PV binding logic. | Always back up PVs with PVCs in stateful applications.<br> • Validate restore completeness before deployment. |
| Cross-Zone Volume Binding Fails with StatefulSet | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, AWS EBS, StatefulSet with anti-affinity | Each pod had a PVC, but volumes couldn’t be bound because the preferred zones didn't match pod scheduling constraints. | Pod events: failed to provision volume with StorageClass "gp2" due to zone mismatch.<br> • kubectl describe pvc showed Pending.<br> • StorageClass had allowedTopologies defined, conflicting with affinity rules. | StatefulSet pods with zone anti-affinity clashed with single-zone EBS volume provisioning. | Updated StorageClass to allow all zones.<br> • Aligned affinity rules with allowed topologies. | StatefulSets and volume topology must be explicitly aligned. | Use multi-zone-aware volume plugins like EFS or FSx when spreading pods. |
| Volume Snapshot Controller Race Condition | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, CSI Snapshot Controller | Automation created/deleted hundreds of snapshots per minute. The controller panicked due to concurrent finalizer modifications. | Observed controller crash loop in logs.<br> • Snapshot objects stuck in Terminating state.<br> • Controller logs: resourceVersion conflict. | Finalizer updates not serialized under high load. | Throttled snapshot requests.<br> • Patched controller deployment to limit concurrency. | High snapshot churn breaks stability. | Monitor snapshot queue metrics.<br> • Apply rate limits in CI/CD snapshot tests. |
| Failed Volume Resize Blocks Rollout | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, CSI VolumeExpansion enabled | Admin updated PVC to request more storage. Resize failed due to volume driver limitation. New pods remained in Pending. | PVC events: resize not supported for current volume type.<br> • Pod events: volume resize pending. | Underlying CSI driver didn't support in-use resize. | Deleted affected pods, allowed volume to unmount.<br> • Resize succeeded offline. | Not all CSI drivers handle online expansion. | Check CSI driver support for in-use expansion.<br> • Add pre-checks before resizing PVCs. |
| Application Data Lost After Node Eviction | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, hostPath volumes | Stateful workloads were evicted. When pods rescheduled on new nodes, the volume path was empty. | Observed empty application directories post-scheduling.<br> • Confirmed hostPath location was not shared across nodes. | hostPath volumes are node-specific and not portable. | Migrated to CSI-based dynamic provisioning.<br> • Used NFS for shared storage. | hostPath is unsafe for stateful production apps. | Use portable CSI drivers for persistent data.<br> • Restrict hostPath usage with admission controllers. |
| Read-Only PV Caused Write Failures After Restore | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, Velero, AWS EBS | Backup included PVCs and PVs, but not associated VolumeAttachment states. Restore marked volume read-only to avoid conflicts. | Pod logs: permission denied on writes.<br> • PVC events: attached in read-only mode.<br> • AWS console showed volume attachment flag. | Velero restored volumes without resetting VolumeAttachment mode. | Detached and reattached the volume manually as read-write.<br> • Updated Velero plugin to handle VolumeAttachment explicitly. | Restores need to preserve attachment metadata. | Validate post-restore PVC/PV attachment states.<br> • Use snapshot/restore plugins that track attachment mode. |
| NFS Server Restart Crashes Pods | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, in-cluster NFS server | NFS mount became stale after server restart. Pods using volumes got stuck in crash loops. | Pod logs: Stale file handle, I/O error.<br> • Kernel logs showed NFS timeout. | NFS state is not stateless across server restarts unless configured. | Enabled NFSv4 stateless mode.<br> • Recovered pods by restarting them post-reboot. | In-cluster storage servers need HA design. | Use managed NFS services or replicated storage.<br> • Add pod liveness checks for filesystem readiness. |
| VolumeBindingBlocked Condition Causes Pod Scheduling Delay | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, dynamic provisioning | PVC triggered provisioning, but until PV was available, pod scheduling was deferred. | Pod condition: PodScheduled: False, reason VolumeBindingBlocked.<br> • StorageClass had delayed provisioning.<br> • PVC was Pending for ~60s. | Volume provisioning time exceeded scheduling delay threshold. | Increased controller timeout thresholds.<br> • Optimized provisioning backend latency. | Storage latency can delay workloads unexpectedly. | Monitor PVC creation latency in Prometheus.<br> • Use pre-created PVCs for latency-sensitive apps. |
| Data Corruption from Overprovisioned Thin Volumes | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, LVM-CSI thin provisioning | Thin pool ran out of physical space during write bursts, leading to partial writes and corrupted files. | Pod logs: checksum mismatches.<br> • Node logs: thin pool out of space.<br> • LVM command showed 100% usage. | Thin provisioning wasn't monitored and exceeded safe limits. | Increased physical volume backing the pool.<br> • Set strict overcommit alerting. | Thin provisioning is risky under unpredictable loads. | Monitor usage with lvdisplay, dmsetup.<br> • Avoid thin pools in production without full monitoring. |
| VolumeProvisioningFailure on GKE Due to IAM Misconfiguration | Storage | GKE, Workload Identity enabled | GCP Persistent Disk CSI driver couldn't create disks because the service account lacked compute permissions. | Event logs: failed to provision volume with StorageClass: permission denied.<br> • IAM policy lacked compute.disks.create. | CSI driver operated under workload identity with incorrect bindings. | Granted missing IAM permissions to the bound service account.<br> • Restarted CSI controller. | IAM and CSI need constant alignment in cloud environments. | Use pre-flight IAM checks during cluster provisioning.<br> • Bind GKE Workload Identity properly. |
| Node Crash Triggers Volume Remount Loop | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, CSI, NVMes | Volume had a static device path cached in CSI driver. Upon node recovery, OS assigned a new device path. CSI couldn't reconcile. | CSI logs: device path not found.<br> • Pod remained in ContainerCreating.<br> • OS showed volume present under different path. | CSI assumed static device path, OS changed it post-reboot. | Added udev rules for consistent device naming.<br> • Restarted CSI daemon to detect new device path. | Relying on device paths can break persistence. | Use device UUIDs or filesystem labels where supported.<br> • Restart CSI pods post-reboot events. |
| VolumeMount Conflict Between Init and Main Containers | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, containerized database restore job | An init container wrote a backup file to a shared volume. The main container expected a clean mount, found conflicting content, and failed on startup. | Pod logs showed file already exists error.<br> • Examined pod manifest: both containers used the same volumeMount.path. | Shared volume path caused file conflicts between lifecycle stages. | Used a subPath for the init container to isolate file writes.<br> • Moved backup logic to an external init job. | Volume sharing across containers must be carefully scoped. | Always use subPath if write behavior differs.<br> • Isolate volume use per container stage when possible. |
| PVCs Stuck in “Terminating” Due to Finalizers | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, CSI driver with finalizer | The CSI driver responsible for finalizer cleanup was crash-looping, preventing PVC finalizer execution. | PVCs had finalizer external-attacher.csi.driver.io.<br> • CSI pod logs showed repeated panics due to malformed config. | Driver bug prevented cleanup logic, blocking PVC deletion. | Patched the driver deployment.<br> • Manually removed finalizers using kubectl patch. | CSI finalizer bugs can block resource lifecycle. | Regularly update CSI drivers.<br> • Monitor PVC lifecycle duration metrics. |
| Misconfigured ReadOnlyMany Mount Blocks Write Operations | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, NFS volume | VolumeMount was incorrectly marked as readOnly: true. Application failed on write attempts. | Application logs: read-only filesystem.<br> • Pod manifest showed readOnly: true. | Misconfiguration in the volumeMounts spec. | Updated the manifest to readOnly: false. | Read-only flags silently break expected behavior. | Validate volume mount flags in CI.<br> • Use initContainer to test mount behavior. |
| In-Tree Plugin PVs Lost After Driver Migration | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, in-tree to CSI migration | Migrated GCE volumes to CSI plugin. Old PVs had legacy annotations and didn’t bind correctly. | PVs showed Unavailable state.<br> • Migration feature gates enabled but missing annotations. | Backward incompatibility in migration logic for pre-existing PVs. | Manually edited PV annotations to match CSI requirements. | Migration feature gates must be tested in staging. | Run migration with shadow mode first.<br> • Migrate PVs gradually using tools like pv-migrate. |
| Pod Deleted but Volume Still Mounted on Node | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, CSI | Force deletion bypassed CSI driver cleanup. Mount lingered and failed future pod volume attach. | kubectl describe node showed volume still attached.<br> • lsblk confirmed mount on node.<br> • Logs showed attach errors. | Orphaned mount due to force deletion. | Manually unmounted the volume on node.<br> • Drained and rebooted the node. | Forced pod deletions should be last resort. | Set up automated orphaned mount detection scripts.<br> • Use graceful deletion with finalizer handling. |
| Ceph RBD Volume Crashes Pods Under IOPS Saturation | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, Ceph CSI | Application workload created sustained random writes. Ceph cluster’s IOPS limit was reached. | dmesg logs: blk_update_request: I/O error.<br> • Pod logs: database fsync errors.<br> • Ceph health: HEALTH_WARN: slow ops. | Ceph RBD pool under-provisioned for the workload. | Migrated to SSD-backed Ceph pools.<br> • Throttled application concurrency. | Distributed storage systems fail silently under stress. | Benchmark storage before rollout.<br> • Alert on high RBD latency. |
| ReplicaSet Using PVCs Fails Due to VolumeClaimTemplate Misuse | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25 | Deployment applied, but pods failed to create PVCs. | Controller logs: volumeClaimTemplates is not supported in ReplicaSet.<br> • No PVCs appeared in kubectl get pvc. | volumeClaimTemplates is only supported in StatefulSet. | Refactored ReplicaSet to StatefulSet. | Not all workload types support dynamic PVCs. | Use workload reference charts during manifest authoring.<br> • Validate manifests with policy engines like OPA. |
| Filesystem Type Mismatch During Volume Attach | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, ext4 vs xfs | Pre-provisioned disk had xfs, but StorageClass defaulted to ext4. | Attach logs: mount failed: wrong fs type.<br> • blkid on node showed xfs. | Filesystem mismatch between PV and node assumptions. | Reformatted disk to ext4.<br> • Aligned StorageClass with PV fsType. | Filesystem types must match across the stack. | Explicitly set fsType in StorageClass.<br> • Document provisioner formatting logic. |
| iSCSI Volumes Fail After Node Kernel Upgrade | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, CSI iSCSI plugin | Kernel upgrade removed or broke iscsi_tcp module needed by CSI driver. | CSI logs: no such device iscsi_tcp.<br> • modprobe iscsi_tcp failed.<br> • Pod events: mount timeout. | Node image didn’t include required kernel modules post-upgrade. | Installed open-iscsi and related modules.<br> • Rebooted node. | OS updates can break CSI compatibility. | Pin node kernel versions.<br> • Run upgrade simulations in canary clusters. |
| PVs Not Deleted After PVC Cleanup Due to Retain Policy | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, AWS EBS | Retain policy on the PV preserved the disk after PVC was deleted. | kubectl get pv showed status Released.<br> • Disk still visible in AWS console. | PV reclaimPolicy was Retain, not Delete. | Manually deleted PVs and EBS volumes. | Retain policy needs operational follow-up. | Use Delete policy unless manual cleanup is required.<br> • Audit dangling PVs regularly. |
| Concurrent Pod Scheduling on the Same PVC Causes Mount Conflict | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, AWS EBS, ReadWriteOnce PVC | A deployment scale-up triggered duplicate pods trying to mount the same EBS volume on different nodes. | One pod was running, the other stuck in ContainerCreating.<br> • Events showed Volume is already attached to another node. | EBS supports ReadWriteOnce, not multi-node attach. | Added anti-affinity to restrict pod scheduling to a single node.<br> • Used EFS (ReadWriteMany) for workloads needing shared storage. | Not all storage supports multi-node access. | Understand volume access modes.<br> • Use StatefulSets or anti-affinity for PVC sharing. |
| StatefulSet Pod Replacement Fails Due to PVC Retention | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, StatefulSet with volumeClaimTemplates | PVC persisted after pod deletion due to StatefulSet retention policy. | kubectl get pvc showed PVC still bound.<br> • New pod stuck in Pending. | StatefulSet retains PVCs unless explicitly deleted. | Deleted old PVC manually to let StatefulSet recreate it. | Stateful PVCs are tightly coupled to pod identity. | Use persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete only when data can be lost.<br> • Automate cleanup for failed StatefulSet replacements. |
| HostPath Volume Access Leaks Host Data into Container | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, single-node dev cluster | Misconfigured path / instead of /data allowed container full read access to host. | Container listed host files under /mnt/host.<br> • Pod manifest showed path: /. | Typo in the volume path. | Corrected volume path in manifest.<br> • Revoked pod access. | HostPath has minimal safety nets. | Avoid using HostPath unless absolutely necessary.<br> • Validate mount paths through automated policies. |
| CSI Driver Crashes When Node Resource Is Deleted Prematurely | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, custom CSI driver | Admin manually deleted a node before volume detach completed. | CSI logs showed panic due to missing node metadata.<br> • Pods remained in Terminating. | Driver attempted to clean up mounts from a non-existent node resource. | Waited for CSI driver to timeout and self-recover.<br> • Rebooted node to forcibly detach volumes. | Node deletion should follow strict lifecycle policies. | Use node cordon + drain before deletion.<br> • Monitor CSI cleanup completion before proceeding. |
| Retained PV Blocks New Claim Binding with Identical Name | Storage | Kubernetes v1.21, NFS | Deleted old PVC and recreated a new one with the same name, but it stayed Pending. | PV was in Released, PVC was Pending.<br> • Events: PVC is not bound. | Retained PV still owned the identity, blocking rebinding. | Manually deleted the old PV to allow dynamic provisioning. | Retain policies require admin cleanup. | Use Delete policy for short-lived PVCs.<br> • Automate orphan PV audits. |
| CSI Plugin Panic on Missing Mount Option | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, custom CSI plugin | StorageClass defined mountOptions: null, causing driver to crash during attach. | CSI logs showed panic: nil pointer dereference.<br> • StorageClass YAML had an empty mountOptions: field. | Plugin didn't check for nil before reading options. | Removed mountOptions: from manifest.<br> • Patched CSI driver to add nil checks. | CSI drivers must gracefully handle incomplete specs. | Validate StorageClass manifests.<br> • Write defensive CSI plugin code. |
| Pod Fails to Mount Volume Due to SELinux Context Mismatch | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, RHEL with SELinux enforcing | Volume was created with an incorrect SELinux context, preventing pod access. | Pod logs: permission denied.<br> • dmesg showed SELinux AVC denial. | Volume not labeled with container_file_t. | Relabeled volume with chcon -Rt container_file_t /data. | SELinux can silently block mounts. | Use CSI drivers that support SELinux integration.<br> • Validate volume contexts post-provisioning. |
| VolumeExpansion on Bound PVC Fails Due to Pod Running | Storage | Kubernetes v1.25, GCP PD | Tried to resize a PVC while its pod was active. | PVC showed Resizing then back to Bound.<br> • Events: PVC resize failed while volume in use. | Filesystem resize required pod to restart. | Deleted pod to trigger offline volume resize.<br> • PVC then showed FileSystemResizePending → Bound. | Some resizes need pod restart. | Plan PVC expansion during maintenance.<br> • Use fsResizePolicy: "OnRestart" if supported. |
| CSI Driver Memory Leak on Volume Detach Loop | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, external CSI | Detach failed repeatedly due to stale metadata, causing plugin to grow in memory use. | Plugin memory exceeded 1GB.<br> • Logs showed repeated detach failed with no backoff. | Driver retry loop without cleanup or GC. | Restarted CSI plugin.<br> • Patched driver to implement exponential backoff. | CSI error paths need memory safety. | Stress-test CSI paths for failure.<br> • Add Prometheus memory alerts for plugins. |
| Volume Mount Timeout Due to Slow Cloud API | Storage | Kubernetes v1.23, Azure Disk CSI | Pods remained in ContainerCreating due to delayed volume attachment. | Event logs: timed out waiting for attach.<br> • Azure portal showed degraded disk API service. | Cloud provider API latency blocked CSI attach. | Waited for Azure API to stabilize.<br> • Used local PVs for critical workloads moving forward. | Cloud API reliability is a hidden dependency. | Use local volumes or ephemeral storage for high-availability needs.<br> • Monitor CSI attach/detach durations. |
| Volume Snapshot Restore Misses Application Consistency | Storage | Kubernetes v1.26, Velero with CSI VolumeSnapshot | A volume snapshot was taken while the database was mid-write. Restore completed, but database wouldn't start due to file inconsistencies. | Restored volume had missing WAL files.<br> • Database logs showed corruption errors.<br> • Snapshot logs showed no pre-freeze hook execution. | No coordination between snapshot and application quiescence. | Integrated pre-freeze and post-thaw hooks via Velero Restic.<br> • Enabled application-aware backups. | Volume snapshot ≠ app-consistent backup. | Use app-specific backup tools or hooks.<br> • Never snapshot during heavy write activity. |
| File Locking Issue Between Multiple Pods on NFS | Storage | Kubernetes v1.22, NFS with ReadWriteMany | Lack of advisory file locking on the NFS server led to race conditions between pods. | Log files had overlapping, corrupted data.<br> • File locks were not honored. | POSIX locks not enforced reliably over NFS. | Introduced flock-based locking in application code.<br> • Used local persistent volume instead for critical data. | NFS doesn’t guarantee strong file locking semantics. | Architect apps to handle distributed file access carefully.<br> • Avoid shared writable files unless absolutely needed. |
| Pod Reboots Erase Data on EmptyDir Volume | Storage | Kubernetes v1.24, default EmptyDir | Logging container used EmptyDir with memory medium. Node rebooted, and logs were lost. | Post-reboot, EmptyDir was reinitialized.<br> • Logs had disappeared from the container volume. | EmptyDir with medium: Memory is ephemeral and tied to node lifecycle. | Switched to hostPath for logs or persisted to object storage. | Understand EmptyDir behavior before using for critical data. | Use PVs or centralized logging for durability.<br> • Avoid medium: Memory unless necessary. |
