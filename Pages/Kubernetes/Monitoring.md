## Advantages of using Thanos over Prometheus

1. ****Scalability and High Availability:**** Thanos addresses one of the main limitations of Prometheus by providing horizontal scalability and high availability. With Thanos, you can scale your Prometheus deployments and handle larger workloads without sacrificing performance or risking data loss.
2. ****Long-term Storage:**** Thanos introduces the ability to store and query historical data over extended periods. By leveraging object storage solutions, you can retain data for months or even years, allowing for trend analysis, capacity planning, and compliance requirements.
3. ****Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery:**** Thanos employs a distributed architecture with redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms. This ensures that even if a Prometheus instance or component fails, data remains available and queryable, reducing the risk of data loss and ensuring business continuity.
4. ****Global View and Federation:**** Thanos enables federation across multiple Prometheus instances, providing a global view of your metrics and facilitating centralized monitoring and analysis. This is particularly useful in large-scale deployments with geographically distributed clusters.

## Prometheus with Thanos

Prometheus and Thanos can work together seamlessly using [Prometheus remote write](https://last9.io/blog/what-is-prometheus-remote-write/) functionality to enhance the overall capabilities of the monitoring and storage infrastructure. Here's how they collaborate:

1. Prometheus Configuration:

In the Prometheus configuration file, you can configure remote write settings to specify the endpoint where Prometheus should send its time series data. This endpoint can be a Thanos Sidecar or Thanos Store.

2. Thanos Sidecar:

Thanos Sidecar, acting as a proxy, receives the remote write data from Prometheus and forwards it to Thanos Store for long-term storage. It ensures that the data is properly compressed, serialized, and pushed to the designated object storage system, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

3. Thanos Store:

Thanos Store is responsible for storing time series data in object storage. It receives the data from Thanos Sidecar and persists it in a scalable and durable manner. Thanos Store supports efficient querying and retrieval of the stored data, which can be later used for analysis, visualization, or long-term historical monitoring.

4. Querying and Analysis:

Thanos Query, the central query engine of Thanos, can perform global queries across multiple Prometheus instances and Thanos Stores. It provides a unified view of the time series data, allowing users to analyze metrics from both real-time and historical perspectives. Users can utilize PromQL, the query language of Prometheus, to execute queries and retrieve the desired information.

By combining Prometheus and Thanos through [remote write](https://last9.io/blog/what-is-prometheus-remote-write/) integration, organizations can achieve the following benefits:

- Long-term Storage: Prometheus offloads its time series data to Thanos Store, allowing for cost-effective and scalable long-term storage of metrics.

- Global Querying: Thanos Query enables users to perform queries that span across multiple Prometheus instances and Thanos Stores, providing a consolidated view of the time series data. This facilitates efficient analysis and monitoring across distributed environments and extended time periods.

- Scalability: Thanos leverages its distributed architecture and object storage systems to scale storage and query capabilities, accommodating growing amounts of data and ensuring optimal performance.

- High Availability: The fault-tolerant design of Thanos, combined with the use of remote write, ensures data reliability and availability, even in the presence of failures in individual Prometheus instances or Thanos components.
