> The Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate the cache key where we hash a combined string of userId + username + password. Under a specific set of conditions, listed below, this could allow users to authenticate by providing the username with the stored cache key of a previous successful authentication.

This means that if the user had a username above 52 chars, any password would suffice to log in. Also, if the username is, letâ€™s say, 50 chars long, it means that the bad actor needs to guess only 3 first chars to get in, which is quite a trivial task for the computers these days.
