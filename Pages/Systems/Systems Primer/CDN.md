A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that are deployed in multiple locations around the world. These servers are designed to deliver web content, such as images, videos, and other static files, to users based on their geographical location. The main purpose of a CDN is to improve the performance and availability of web content by caching it on servers that are closer to the users who are requesting it.
