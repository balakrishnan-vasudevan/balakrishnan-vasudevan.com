1. User clicks on "Forgot Password" link and shares username/email.
2. Request sent to API GW.
3. API GW checks with the rate limiter to make sure that it is not being DDoSed. 
	   Ensure that the rate limiter considers user-specific limits (e.g., limiting requests by IP, user, or email). Consider adding CAPTCHA challenges after a certain number of failed requests to prevent automated attacks.
4. User service receives the request.
5. User service checks if the user exists in the user db.
	   Make sure to include rate-limiting logic here as well, so repeated password reset attempts for a non-existent user do not trigger unnecessary processing.
6. If the user is present, the user service creates a token for the user in the session database.
	   • Ensure that tokens are securely generated (e.g., using a cryptographically secure random string). 
	   • Tokens should be short-lived (15-30 minutes) to minimize abuse. • The token format should be designed in such a way that it cannot be easily guessed or brute-forced.
7. The token is also stored in the Sessions cache which could be using Redis.
	   • Ensure the token is only valid for a short period and expires after use or timeout. 
	   • Make sure the session cache uses secure access mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the tokens.
8. user service shares this token to the notification service.
	• Ensure that the email is sent via a reliable, trusted email provider (e.g., SendGrid, SES) with mechanisms to handle delivery failures. • Consider logging or tracking email deliveries to ensure reliability.
9. Notification service sends an email to the user with the token in the form of a link.
    Compliant: This is standard practice. The email should contain a link that points to the password reset page, including the token as a URL parameter or hidden form field.
10. User receives the email and clicks on the link.
	    Ensure that the link expires after a short time or is invalidated after use.
11. The user service now receives the request to reset the password. User service checks the sessions cache to see if the token is valid, if it is valid, it opens a page for the user to change their password.
    • Session Validation: Ensure that the token is valid, has not expired, and hasn’t been used previously. If invalid, return an appropriate error to the user (e.g., token expired or invalid link). • One-Time Use Token: After the token is validated and the password is reset, invalidate the token to prevent reuse.
12. new password is hashed and saved to the users database.
    • Ensure strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) are used. 
    • Salt the passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks. 
    • Apply password strength validation before saving the new password (e.g., minimum length, complexity rules).

![[Pasted image 20250331101118.png]]

Your solution covers most of the critical aspects of a password reset service quite well! Here's an evaluation with some suggestions for improvements:

### Strong points of your design:

- Good security considerations with rate limiting and token management
- Proper separation of concerns (user service, notification service)
- Solid approach to token generation, storage, and validation
- Appropriate password security with hashing

### Areas for improvement:

1. **Audit logging**
    
    - Add comprehensive logging throughout the flow to track reset attempts, successes, and failures
    - This helps with security investigations and troubleshooting
2. **Multi-channel verification**
    
    - Consider offering SMS as an alternative to email for delivering reset tokens
    - For high-security applications, implement a two-factor approach (email token + SMS code)
3. **Account lockout policy**
    
    - Define what happens after X failed verification attempts
    - Include a process for unlocking accounts that become locked
4. **User notifications**
    
    - Send confirmation emails when passwords are successfully changed
    - Consider notifying users of unsuccessful attempts from unfamiliar devices/locations
5. **Token handling improvements**
    
    - Use signed JWTs instead of random tokens for better security and validation
    - Include user metadata in the token payload for additional verification
6. **Fallback mechanisms**
    
    - Add recovery options for users who can't access their email
    - Consider security questions or backup codes as alternatives
7. **Error handling**
    
    - More detailed error handling throughout the flow
    - User-friendly error messages that don't reveal system details
8. **Event-driven architecture**
    
    - Consider using an event queue between components for better scalability and reliability
    - Makes the system more resilient to service outages

These improvements would make your already solid solution more robust, secure, and user-friendly. Is there any particular aspect you'd like me to explore in more depth?

**Redis as Session Store**

• **Sessions in Redis**: You can store user session data (such as the reset token and expiration) directly in Redis. When a user requests a password reset, you can create a session entry in Redis with a unique token and expiration time.

• **Session Validation**: Redis will allow you to quickly check if the session/token exists and if it has expired. Once the password reset process is completed, you can invalidate the session (delete or expire the key).

**Redis as Cache**

• **Caching Data**: Redis is also used as a cache for frequently accessed data to improve performance. In your case, if you don’t need to store user session data persistently but only need it for short-term, Redis will work as a caching mechanism.

**Do You Need Both?**

• **No, You Don’t Need a Separate Cache** if Redis is already managing session data. In fact, using Redis both as a **session store** and a **cache** is a common pattern. You can use Redis to store:

• **Session Tokens** (valid for password resets)

• **Temporary Data** (e.g., confirmation codes, OTPs)

• **Caching data** like user information, preferences, etc.

However, if your application requires long-term data storage (beyond Redis’s typical TTL behavior) or needs to scale horizontally across multiple data centers, you may want to integrate a **more persistent database** alongside Redis.

**When Might You Need a Separate Cache?**

You would typically consider using a **separate cache** (other than Redis) in cases where:

1. **Data is less time-sensitive**: If you want to cache data that doesn’t require frequent expiration (e.g., product catalogs, public API responses).
    
2. **Multi-Region/Distributed Scaling**: If you’re scaling your system across multiple regions, you may want to separate session data and cache data to optimize regional performance.
    
3. **Persistence Needs**: If the data in the cache has different durability needs, such as ensuring no loss during service restarts.


Your design for the password reset system looks well thought out, with clear steps for validating the user and securely handling the reset token. Here’s a quick breakdown of each step in the workflow and some suggestions:

1. **User Clicks "Forgot Password"**: This initiates the password reset process. Ensure that the user’s input (email/username) is validated to prevent injection attacks.
2. **API Gateway & Rate Limiting**: Great inclusion of a rate limiter to prevent abuse. This is particularly useful to mitigate brute-force attacks or DDoS attempts on the password reset endpoint.
3. **User Service & User Database Check**: Verifying the user exists before proceeding is a standard practice. Ensure the user is informed (without revealing too much) if the account doesn’t exist.
4. **Token Generation and Session Storage**:
    - Storing the token in both the **Sessions Database** and **Session Cache** (Redis) is effective for quick lookups.
    - Make sure the token has an expiration time to limit its validity period (usually a few hours).
    - Consider encrypting the token before storing it, or at least using a secure, random generation method to prevent predictable tokens.
5. **Notification Service**:
    - This service sending an email is straightforward. Ensure the link format in the email follows a secure scheme (e.g., HTTPS).
    - Avoid revealing the exact reason if an email is not sent, as this could expose information about account existence.
6. **User Clicks Link**: When the user clicks the link, the system should validate the token immediately to ensure it hasn’t expired or been tampered with.
7. **Password Reset Process**:
    - After token validation, display a secure password reset page.
    - When saving the new password, ensure it is hashed (e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2) before storing it in the database.
    - Enforce password complexity requirements to enhance security.
8. **Final Cleanup (Optional)**:
    - After resetting the password, you may want to delete the token from the cache and database to avoid reuse.
    - Consider logging out other active sessions if the password was compromised.

Analysis of the Password Reset System

This system is primarily write-heavy because every password reset request involves multiple write operations:

1. Storing a token in the session database

2. Caching the token in Redis

3. Logging the request

4. Writing the new hashed password to the user database

  

There are some read operations (e.g., checking if a user exists, validating tokens), but the bulk of the work involves writes, making this a write-heavy system.

Key Components & Design Considerations

1. API Gateway (API GW)

• First point of contact for users.

• Implements rate limiting and DDoS protection to prevent abuse.

• Routes requests to the correct internal services.

2. Rate Limiter

• Protects against brute-force attempts.

• Could use a distributed token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm (e.g., with Redis or a dedicated service like Envoy).

3. User Service

• Handles identity management and validation.

• Queries the User Database to check if the user exists.

• Generates password reset tokens, stores them in the Session Database, and caches them in Redis.

• Hashes and updates the new password after user confirmation.

4. Session Database & Cache (Redis)

• Session Database (SQL or NoSQL): Stores tokens for password reset requests.

• Redis Cache: Speeds up token lookups to reduce database load.

• Uses TTL-based expiry (e.g., 10-15 minutes) to prevent stale tokens.

5. Notification Service

• Sends password reset emails.

• Uses a global email provider like AWS SES, SendGrid, or Postmark.

• Should be asynchronous to prevent blocking user requests.

6. User Database

• Stores user credentials securely (hashed & salted).

• Uses strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

• Should support high writes and eventual consistency across regions.


Distributed System Trade-offs & Challenges
  

Since the system must be globally distributed and highly available, here are some key trade-offs:

  

1. CAP Theorem Considerations

• This system leans towards CP (Consistency & Partition Tolerance) because password reset operations must be strongly consistent (i.e., users should not be able to use an expired or invalid token).

• Availability is secondary because a user can always retry a password reset if a specific region is temporarily down.

  

2. Rate Limiting Trade-offs

• Too strict? Users might get locked out if they request multiple resets.

• Too lenient? Can be abused for enumeration attacks.

• Geo-aware rate limiting (allow higher limits for frequent IPs) can balance this.

  

3. Token Storage & Caching Trade-offs

• Redis-only storage? Fast, but non-persistent (risk of losing tokens on Redis crash).

• DB-only storage? Persistent, but slower due to additional reads.

• Hybrid approach (Redis + DB)? Best of both worlds—fast token validation while ensuring persistence.

  

4. Email Delivery Trade-offs

• Synchronous vs. Asynchronous?

• Synchronous email delivery (blocking user request) ensures immediate sending but increases response time.

• Asynchronous (via message queue like Kafka or SQS) improves performance but can introduce a slight delay.

• Retry Mechanism? If an email provider fails, should we retry immediately, use exponential backoff, or use multiple providers?

  

5. Database Scalability Trade-offs

• SQL vs. NoSQL for User DB?

• SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) ensures strong consistency but scales poorly with high write throughput.

• NoSQL (DynamoDB, Cassandra) offers high availability but may introduce eventual consistency issues when resetting passwords across regions.

  

6. Hashing Algorithm Trade-offs

• bcrypt? Secure but slower for high loads.

• Argon2? More secure but computationally expensive.

• PBKDF2? More battle-tested but not as resistant to modern GPU attacks.

  

7. Handling Multi-Region Deployments

• Problem: User in the US requests a reset, but the reset token is stored in a session DB in Europe.

• Solution: Use a global session cache (e.g., Redis with Geo-Replication) or replicated databases to ensure users can access tokens from any region.

• Trade-off: Strong consistency (ACID) vs. faster replication with potential delays.
  

Conclusion

This password reset service is write-heavy, requiring careful design decisions around rate limiting, token storage, email notifications, and database scalability. The biggest trade-offs involve security vs. performance and consistency vs. availability in a distributed system.


### Additional Considerations:

- **Audit Logging**: Track and log each step, especially token creation, email dispatch, and password reset attempts.
- **Token Throttling**: If a user requests multiple reset tokens, invalidate the previous tokens or set a maximum number of requests within a time frame.
- **User Feedback**: Make sure the user is notified appropriately throughout the process, especially if the reset attempt fails for some reason.

This design should cover the main requirements for a secure password reset process and effectively prevent common security issues associated with such flows.

In a large-scale system, checking if a user exists in the user database efficiently is crucial. Here’s how we can optimize the lookup process:

**Optimized Approach for User Lookup in a Large DB**

1. **Use an Indexed Search (Primary or Secondary Index)**

• Ensure that **email/username** is indexed in the user database to make lookups efficient.

• In relational databases like **PostgreSQL/MySQL**, create an index:

CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

• In NoSQL databases like **MongoDB**, create an indexed collection:

db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 })

2. **Use a Caching Layer (Redis) for Frequent Lookups**

• Maintain a **cache** (e.g., Redis) that stores frequently queried user email/IDs.

• Before querying the database, check **Redis**:

GET user:<email>

• If found, return the user ID from cache, avoiding a DB query.

• If not found, **query the DB and cache the result**:

SET user:<email> <user_id> EX 600  # Cache for 10 minutes

3. **Use an Eventual Consistency Pattern**

• If a new user is added, trigger an event to **preload Redis** with their details.

4. **Use a Read Replica for Heavy Reads**

• If the user lookup is causing database contention, **offload reads to a replica**:

• Primary DB → Handles writes.

• Read Replica → Handles lookups.

• Route lookup requests to the **replica DB**.

5. **Use a Bloom Filter for Quick Existence Check**

• Before hitting Redis/DB, use a **Bloom filter** (probabilistic data structure) to check if the user **might** exist.

• Bloom filters are extremely fast and **avoid unnecessary DB queries**.

• Example using Redis:

BF.ADD users_filter <email>

BF.EXISTS users_filter <email>

6. **Use a Dedicated Service for Authentication Data**

• Instead of looking up in a monolithic user DB, use a separate **authentication service** with a lightweight **key-value store** (e.g., DynamoDB, Redis, or CockroachDB) for quick lookups.

**Updated Control Flow with Optimized Lookup**

1. **User clicks “Forgot Password” and enters email.**
    
2. **API Gateway** receives the request and rate limits it.
    
3. **User Service** queries Redis for user:<email>:
    

• If found → proceed to generate token.

• If not found → check the Bloom filter:

• If Bloom filter returns **“No”**, immediately return an error.

• If Bloom filter returns **“Maybe”**, query the DB.

4. If the DB finds the user, cache the result in Redis for future lookups.
    
5. Proceed with **token generation, email notification, and password reset process**.
    

**Why This Works Well**

✅ **Fast**: Lookup is O(1) in Redis and O(log n) in a properly indexed database.

✅ **Scalable**: Read replicas distribute traffic.

✅ **Efficient**: Avoids unnecessary DB queries using **Bloom filters & caching**.

✅ **DDoS-Resistant**: Rate limiting and caching prevent excessive database hits.

Would you like me to refine any part of the architecture further? 🚀

|---|---|---|
|Issue|What could happen?|Solution|
|Token Theft or Abuse|- If the token is intercepted (e.g., through email hacking or an insecure link), an attacker could gain unauthorized access to reset the user's password.  <br>- If the token is too simple or has a long lifespan, it increases the attack surface for brute force or replay attacks.|Use HTTPS: Ensure that all communication, especially emails containing sensitive links, happens over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  <br>• Token Expiry: Set short expiration times for the reset token (e.g., 15-30 minutes). This reduces the window for token misuse.  <br>• One-Time Use Token: Make sure the token can only be used once. After the token is used, invalidate it immediately.  <br>• Token Complexity: Generate tokens with high entropy, such as cryptographically secure random strings (e.g., UUIDs, JWTs with secure signing).|
|Session Hijacking|- The link in the email may include the token directly in the URL. If clicked on an unsecured network or if logs capture the URL, the token may be exposed.|• Avoid URL Tokens: Pass the token via POST requests or use hidden form fields instead of including it in the URL. This avoids exposure in browser history or web server logs.  <br>• Token in Cookies (Secure, HttpOnly): Use a secure, HttpOnly cookie to store the token when the user clicks the reset link. This prevents exposure via URL.  <br>• Secure Links: If you must use URLs, ensure they are only accessible through secure networks and disable the token after the first use.|
|Email Delivery Issues|- Emails containing tokens can be delayed, flagged as spam, or fail to reach the user. This could cause inconvenience or service denial.|• Fallback Mechanism: Implement a retry mechanism for failed email delivery attempts. For example, if the first email fails, retry sending the email after a few minutes.  <br>• Email Service Monitoring: Use services like SendGrid, SES, or Mailgun that offer delivery tracking and retry mechanisms.  <br>• Clear User Communication: Provide a way for users to request a new token if they don’t receive the email in a reasonable amount of time.  <br>• Check for Spam: Consider including an option for users to check their spam/junk folders in case the email is flagged.|
|Rate Limiting Bypass|- Attackers could exploit weak or misconfigured rate-limiting rules to launch a DDoS attack or brute-force username/email enumeration.|• Strong Rate Limiting: Ensure that rate limiting is enforced both at the API Gateway and within the User Service. Implement limits on the number of reset requests per user or IP address.  <br>• CAPTCHA Challenge: Add a CAPTCHA challenge for the “Forgot Password” page to prevent automated attacks.  <br>• Geo-Location Blocking: In case of repeated suspicious activity from a specific geographic region, consider temporarily blocking requests or requiring additional verification.|
|Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication|- A reset token alone may not be secure enough. Adding a secondary verification step (e.g., a code sent to the user's phone) increases security.|• MFA Integration: Implement multi-factor authentication as an additional verification step when resetting the password. For example, after the user clicks the reset link, send a one-time passcode (OTP) to their phone or via an authenticator app.  <br>• Adaptive Authentication: For higher-risk users or regions, consider enforcing stronger verification steps (e.g., email, phone, and security questions).|
|Weak Password Policies|- If the new password doesn't follow strong password guidelines, it may make the account vulnerable to future attacks.|• Enforce Strong Passwords: Implement password complexity rules, such as:  <br>• Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters)  <br>• Must include upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols  <br>• Prohibit common or breached passwords (integrating services like HaveIBeenPwned)  <br>• Password Strength Indicator: Provide users with feedback on password strength while they create a new password.|
|Expired Tokens|- Tokens may expire too quickly or not quickly enough, potentially frustrating users or increasing the attack window.|• Appropriate Expiry Time: Set the token expiry window to a reasonable time (15-30 minutes), balancing user convenience and security. If the token is unused after that period, it expires automatically.  <br>• Grace Period: If the token expires but the user is still actively engaged (e.g., they’re trying to reset their password), provide a way for them to easily regenerate a new token via another request.|




### **Failure Modes**

1. **Rate Limiter Misconfiguration**:
    - Legitimate users may be throttled or blocked due to overly aggressive rate limiting.
2. **Session Cache Unavailability**:
    - If the Redis session cache goes down, the token verification process would fail.
3. **User Database Outage**:
    - If the user database is unavailable, the system cannot validate user existence or store the updated password.
4. **Email Delivery Failures**:
    - If the notification service or email provider fails, users won't receive the reset link.
5. **Expired Token Scenario**:
    - If the token expires too quickly, users may lose the opportunity to reset their password without restarting the process.
6. **API Gateway Failure**:
    - If the API Gateway is unavailable, users can't initiate the reset process.

---

### **Resiliency and Availability Improvements**

1. **Redundant Systems**:
    - Use redundant infrastructure for the API Gateway, User Service, Notification Service, and Redis to prevent single points of failure.
    - Use database replication or partitioning for the user and session databases.
2. **Circuit Breakers and Fallbacks**:
    - Implement circuit breakers to gracefully handle downstream service failures.
    - Provide fallback mechanisms like alternative notification channels (e.g., SMS).
3. **Retry Mechanisms**:
    - Introduce retry logic for transient errors, especially for email delivery or database writes.
4. **Load Balancing**:
    - Use load balancers to distribute requests across multiple instances of the service components.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - Monitor critical components and set up alerts for issues like high latency, failed emails, or token cache misses.
6. **Scalable Caching**:
    - Use a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis Cluster) for session tokens to handle high traffic.

---

### **Security Enhancements**

1. **Secure Token Generation**:
    - Use cryptographically secure random numbers for tokens.
    - Set a short expiration time (e.g., 15–30 minutes).
2. **HTTPS Everywhere**:
    - Ensure all communications use HTTPS to prevent token interception.
3. **Token Scoping**:
    - Ensure tokens are single-use and scoped only to reset the password.
4. **Second Factor Verification**:
    - Require users to confirm their identity using a secondary factor, such as a code sent to their phone or a security question.
5. **Rate-Limiting Improvements**:
    - Implement IP-based rate limiting and user-specific rate limiting to prevent abuse.
6. **Audit Logging**:
    - Log all password reset attempts and notify users of any suspicious activity.
7. **Password Policy Enforcement**:
    - Enforce strong password requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters) during the reset process.
8. **Token Revocation**:
    - Invalidate existing tokens when a new token is generated or if the user logs in successfully.

This enhanced design improves the security, resiliency, and user experience of the password reset service while mitigating common failure modes.

</aside>

Your solution is well-structured and follows a secure and scalable approach. However, there are several ways to **improve reliability, resiliency, and global deployment**. Let’s analyze and enhance your design.

**Improvements to Reliability**

1. **Ensuring Idempotency & Handling Retries**:

• If a user requests multiple password reset emails, ensure the system doesn’t generate multiple valid tokens simultaneously. Either **invalidate old tokens** when a new request is made or allow only the latest token.

• Implement **retry mechanisms** in API Gateway and notification service to handle transient failures.

2. **Session Store (Redis) Resiliency**:

• Since Redis is used for storing reset tokens, ensure **high availability** with a **replicated Redis cluster** and **persistent storage** (e.g., AWS ElastiCache with Multi-AZ, Azure Cache for Redis with Geo-Replication).

• If Redis is unavailable, **fallback to a secondary store** (e.g., a database).

3. **Email Delivery Reliability**:

• Use a third-party email service like **SES (AWS), SendGrid, or Postmark** with retries and logging.

• Implement **webhooks for email bounce tracking**, and retry delivery if necessary.

4. **User Database Replication**:

• Ensure **multi-node replication** in the primary region and **read replicas** for availability.

• Use **strong consistency** for password update operations.

5. **API Gateway Rate Limiting and Security**:

• Use **reCAPTCHA or other bot protection** to prevent automated attacks.

• Implement **HMAC or JWT signing** for the token to prevent tampering.

**Global Deployment: Multi-Region or Multi-Continent Setup**

If deploying in **three regions (or continents)**, we need to handle:

1. **Data Replication & Consistency**:

• **User Database**:

• **Primary-Replica Setup**: A primary database in one region with read replicas in others (eventual consistency).

• **Multi-Master (Active-Active)**: Consider **CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, or AWS DynamoDB Global Tables** for low-latency writes.

• **Session Store (Redis)**

• Use **Redis Global Replication** or **DynamoDB TTL-based tokens**.

2. **Traffic Routing & Load Balancing**:

• Deploy API Gateways in each region.

• Use **Global Load Balancers (e.g., AWS Route 53, Azure Traffic Manager, or Cloudflare)** to route users to the nearest region.

• **Geo-DNS resolution** ensures users always hit the closest API gateway.

3. **Regionalized Notification Delivery**:

• Use regional email service providers for faster delivery (AWS SES, GCP SendGrid).

• Implement **regional failover**, so if email service fails in one region, another region handles it.

4. **Handling Password Reset Token in Multi-Region Setup**:

• **Option 1: Globally Distributed Session Store** (e.g., Redis with Active-Active Sync, DynamoDB Global Tables).

• **Option 2: Hash-Based Token Validation**

• Instead of storing the token in Redis, generate a **HMAC-signed JWT with expiration**.

• JWT validation can be stateless across regions.

5. **CI/CD and Deployment Considerations**:

• Deploy **API, User Service, Notification Service** in all regions.

• Implement **blue-green deployments** for seamless updates.

• Use **database schema migration tools (Flyway, Liquibase)** for consistent updates across regions.

**Improved System Flow with Global Deployment Considerations**

**Final Thoughts**

• Your initial design is solid, but **improving reliability** involves **regional resilience**, **failover mechanisms**, and **token handling improvements**.

• The use of **JWT-based tokens** can remove the reliance on Redis across multiple regions.

• **Global Load Balancing and Active-Active Databases** ensure low-latency operations across continents.

Would you like a more detailed breakdown on any of these areas? 🚀

Here’s the **sequence of steps** in the password reset flow with a focus on **control flow, data flow, and resilience**.

**Step-by-Step Password Reset Flow**

**1️⃣ User Initiates Password Reset**

1. User clicks the **“Forgot Password”** link on the login page.
    
2. The front-end prompts the user to enter their **email or username**.
    
3. The front-end sends a **POST** request to the **API Gateway** with the user’s input.
    

**2️⃣ API Gateway Processing**

4. The **API Gateway** checks with the **Rate Limiter** (e.g., Redis, Kong, Cloudflare WAF) to prevent abuse (e.g., DDoS, brute force attacks).
    
5. If the request is valid, the API Gateway forwards it to the **User Service**.
    

**3️⃣ User Service Validates and Generates Token**

6. The **User Service**:

• Queries the **User Database** (Primary-Replica) to check if the user exists.

• If the user **does not exist**, it returns a generic response (200 OK to prevent username enumeration attacks).

• If the user **exists**, it generates a **password reset token**.

7. The reset token is:

• A **randomly generated secure string**.

• **Has an expiration time** (e.g., **15 minutes**).

• **Stored in Redis** (or another session store) with an expiry.

• Optionally, hashed using **HMAC** before storage.

8. The **User Service** passes the token and user’s email to the **Notification Service**.

**4️⃣ Notification Service Sends Email**

9. The **Notification Service**:

• Constructs a **password reset email** with a **reset link** like:

```
<https://app.example.com/reset-password?token=abcd1234>
```

• Sends the email using **SendGrid, SES, or another email provider**.

• Logs the email request for monitoring.

**5️⃣ User Receives and Clicks Reset Link**

10. The user **receives the email** and clicks on the **password reset link**.
    
11. The front-end sends a **GET request** to the **API Gateway** with the token.
    

**6️⃣ API Gateway Forwards Token to User Service**

12. The API Gateway forwards the request to the **User Service**.
    
13. The **User Service**:
    

• Checks if the token exists in **Redis** (or another session store).

• Validates the **expiration time**.

• If valid, returns a success response (200 OK) and the front-end loads the **reset password form**.

• If invalid or expired, returns an error (401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden).

**7️⃣ User Submits New Password**

14. The user enters a **new password** and submits the form.
    
15. The front-end sends a **POST request** to the API Gateway with:
    

• **Token**

• **New password**

**8️⃣ Validate Token and Update Password**

16. The **API Gateway** forwards the request to the **User Service**.
    
17. The **User Service**:
    

• Validates the **token** against Redis.

• If valid:

• Hashes the new password (e.g., **bcrypt, Argon2**).

• Updates the **User Database** with the new password.

• Deletes the token from Redis.

• If invalid, returns an error (403 Forbidden).

**9️⃣ Final Response**

18. The service responds with a **success message**.
    
19. The front-end redirects the user to the login page.
    
20. User can now log in with the new password.
    

**Failure Handling & Resilience Considerations**

|**Failure**|**Mitigation**|
|---|---|
|**Email not received**|Retry sending via fallback email provider. Add webhooks to track bounced emails.|
|**Token expired**|Show “Token expired” message and ask the user to request a new reset.|
|**DDoS attack on API**|Implement **rate limiting, CAPTCHA, IP blacklisting**.|
|**Race condition (simultaneous token use)**|Store the **latest token only** per user. Use an **HMAC signature** to prevent forgery.|
|**Partial DB failure**|Use a **read replica** for read-heavy requests. Ensure **multi-region failover** for critical writes.|

**Key Technologies Used**

• **API Gateway** → (Kong, AWS API Gateway, Nginx)

• **Rate Limiting** → (Redis, Cloudflare WAF, Nginx)

• **User Database** → (PostgreSQL, MySQL, DynamoDB, CockroachDB)

• **Session Store** → (Redis, DynamoDB TTL)

• **Email Service** → (AWS SES, SendGrid, Postmark)

• **Password Hashing** → (bcrypt, Argon2)

This flow ensures **security, scalability, and reliability** across different failure scenarios. Would you like further details on any of these steps? 🚀
