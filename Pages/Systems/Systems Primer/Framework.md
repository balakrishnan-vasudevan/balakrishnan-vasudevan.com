The Best System Design Building Blocks You Should Know  
  
1. Distributed messaging queues: Facilitates communication between different parts of the system by providing a reliable message broker.  
2. DNS (Domain Name System): Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses for proper traffic routing.  
3. Load balancer: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to avoid overload and ensure efficiency.  
4. Distributed caching: Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and speed up response times.  
5. Database: Stores and manages data; It includes relational databases and document databases.  
6. Distributed Task Scheduler: Manage task execution across multiple servers for efficiency and reliability.  
7. Observability: Measures system performance and health through monitoring, logging, and tracking.  
8. Unstructured Data Storage: Handles large amounts of unstructured data such as files and multimedia documents.  
9. Scaling services: Ensures that the application can handle a higher load by dynamically adding resources.  
10. Publish-subscribe model (Pub-Sub): Allows asynchronous communication between services with decoupled messaging.  
11. Unique ID Generator: Provides unique identifiers to maintain data integrity and consistency across distributed systems.  
12. Rate Limiting: Controls the rate of requests from clients to a server to avoid overhead and ensure fair usage.
