- ###  Data Replication 
  Data replication is making several copies of data and storing them at different locations. The objective is to guarantee data availability even when some nodes fail. A major issue in data replication is data consistency.
- ### Checkpointing 
  A checkpoint is a set of information defining a system in a consistent state that’s saved in a safe location. This information includes environment, [process](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/process-lifecycle) state, active registers and variables, etc. Whenever the system breaks down, we restore it to a recently created checkpoint. Although it benefits us by saving computational power, it’s time-consuming.
- ### Redundancy 
  Redundancy refers to having [backup](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/backup-policies) systems or components, such as [databases](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/microservices-db-design) or servers, take over when other components fail. Primarily, it increases the system’s reliability.
- ### Error Detection and Correction 
  Data corruption is a potential fault when transmitting data due to several causes, such as noise or cross-talk. Error detection helps recognize such corruptions using several mechanisms, namely [parity bits](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/calculating-parity-bit), [checksum](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/tcp-checksum-errors), [hamming code](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/hamming-code-error-detection-correction), and [cyclic redundancy checks (CRC)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/crc-vs-checksum#whats-a-cyclic-redundancy-check).
- ### Load Balancing 
  This process includes distributing traffic among nodes. More specifically, if a node fails or gets overloaded, we can redirect the traffic to another functioning node to prevent a single failure from harming the entire system.
- ### Consensus Algorithms 
  [Consensus algorithms](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/consensus-algorithms-distributed-systems) enable distributed systems to agree on the sequence of operations and guarantee data accuracy even with a component failure or a network partition. For example, we can use methods such as [Paxos](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf) and [Raft](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf).
