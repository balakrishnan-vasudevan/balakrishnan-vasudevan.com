- MySQL is preferred for managing read-only commands. It is not preferred when concurrency is required.
- PostgreSQL is preferred for managing read-write operations, large datasets, and complex queries. But it’s not preferred for read-only operations. 
- MySQL offers fewer features than PostgreSQL, but this allows MySQL to stay lighter, more stable, and faster at processing—especially when it comes to read-only queries.
- PostgreSQL was built to be [ACID-compliant](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/ACID) from the ground up and it’s optimal when concurrent transactions (MVCC) are required, but it is slower and less stable when it comes to read-only operations. 
- MySQL is highly compatible with many different types of data storage engines. Whereas PostgreSQL is highly compatible with many different NoSQL formats.
