Key Features: ● Wide column data store (NoSQL), has a shard key and a sort key ○ Allows for flexible schemas, ease of partitioning ● Multileader/Leaderless replication (configurable) ○ Super fast writes, supports CRDTs (conflict free replicated data types) ○ Allows for implementing things like counters and sets in a conflict free way, custom code to handle conflicts ● Index based off of LSM tree and SSTables ○ Fast writes Conclusion: Great for applications with high write volume, consistency is not as important, all writes and reads go to the same shard (no transactions) ● See chat application for a good example of when to use
