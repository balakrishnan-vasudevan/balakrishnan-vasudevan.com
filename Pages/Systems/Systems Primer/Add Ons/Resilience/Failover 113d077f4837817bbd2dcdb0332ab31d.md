In modern distributed systems, failover mechanisms are critical to maintaining system reliability and availability. Failover refers to the process of automatically switching to a backup component or system when the primary system fails. Failover helps prevent downtime and service disruption when parts of a system fail.

Failover Mechanism

Below are the different types of failovers in distributed system:

- Active-Passive
- Active-Active
- Manual vs. Automatic Failover

**Failover Time** is the total time it takes to switch from the primary server to the backup server.

The total failover time T_failover can be calculated as below:

```
T_failover = T_detect + T_initiate + T_activate + T_sync
```

Here, the backup system (passive) is idle and only takes over when the primary system (active) fails.
