We need a mechanism to detect failures and disseminate the failure information through the network. This is where Group Membership Protocols come into picture. We give every process a membership list. A membership list contains the list of all processes along with its last heartbeat. (Heartbeat refers to the last time the process P communicated with the current process.)

Now that every process has a membership list, we need to detect failures. Once a failure is detected, this process needs to be removed from all membership lists. How do we achieve this?

**Heartbeat Protocol**

A process P sends a heartbeat(message) to process Q telling that it is alive. If Q does not receive the heartbeat, it assumes that process P is dead.

The topology could be varied. All processes might send heartbeats to a centralized node or they could send it to all other processes.

There are some very obvious disadvantages here. Centralized Heartbbeating is dependent on one central process. If that fails, everything fails. All to All Heartbeating has an increased overhead of sending heartbeats to all the processes.

So how do we optimise?

**Gossip- Style Membership**

Every process randomly selects n processes and sends them a heartbeat. Each of these processes will update their membership lists and send out a heartbeat to n processes again randomly selected. If the heartbeat does not increase even after T_fail seconds, the process is considered fail. It waits for another T_cleanup seconds before it deletes the member from the membership list.

A single heartbeat takes O(log N) time to propagate and N heartbeats take O(N log(N)) time.

Can we optimize further?

**SWIM Failure Detector Protocol**

SWIM (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style) uses membership lists along with a protocol period T. A process Pi randomly picks a process Pj in its membership list and pings it. If it does not receive an ACK within the timeout period, it selects k other targets and uses them to send a message to Pj. The ACK is passed on from these k targets to Pi. If Pi doesnâ€™t receive an ACK within T, it declares Pj as failed.

Data centers use more complex failure prediction and detection models which use these protocols as the building blocks.
