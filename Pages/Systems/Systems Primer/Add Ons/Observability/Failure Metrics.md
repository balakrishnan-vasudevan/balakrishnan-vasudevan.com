**Mean time to recovery** tells you how quickly you can get your systems back up and running.

Layer in **mean time to respond** and you get a sense for how much of the recovery time belongs to the team and how much is your alert system.

Further layer in **mean time to repair** and you start to see how much time the team is spending on repairs vs. diagnostics.

Add **mean time to resolve** to the mix and you start to understand the full scope of fixing and resolving issues beyond the actual downtime they cause.

Fold in **mean time between failures** and the picture gets even bigger, showing you how successful your team is at preventing or reducing future issues.

And then add **mean time to failure** to understand the full lifecycle of a product or system.
