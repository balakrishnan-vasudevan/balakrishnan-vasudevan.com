#### Sub-millisecond latency

Both Redis and Memcached support sub-millisecond response times. By storing data in-memory they can read data more quickly than disk based databases.

#### Developer ease of use

Both Redis and Memcached are syntactically easy to use and require a minimal amount of code to integrate into your application.

#### Data partitioning

Both Redis and Memcached allow you to distribute your data among multiple nodes. This allows you to scale out to better handle more data when demand grows.

#### Support for a broad set of programming languages

Both Redis and Memcached have many open-source clients available for developers. Supported languages include Java, Python, PHP, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Node.js, Ruby, Go and many others.

#### Advanced data structures

In addition to strings, Redis supports lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bit arrays, and hyperloglogs. Applications can use these more advanced data structures to support a variety of use cases. For example, you can use Redis Sorted Sets to easily implement a game leaderboard that keeps a list of players sorted by their rank.

#### Multithreaded architecture

Since Memcached is multithreaded, it can make use of multiple processing cores. This means that you can handle more operations by scaling up compute capacity.

#### Snapshots

With Redis you can keep your data on disk with a point in time snapshot which can be used for archiving or recovery.

#### Replication

Redis lets you create multiple replicas of a Redis primary. This allows you to scale database reads and to have highly available clusters.

#### Transactions

Redis supports transactions which let you execute a group of commands as an isolated and atomic operation.

#### Pub/Sub

Redis supports Pub/Sub messaging with pattern matching which you can use for high performance [chat rooms](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-to-build-a-chat-application-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis/), real-time comment streams, social media feeds, and server intercommunication.

#### Lua scripting

Redis allows you to execute transactional Lua scripts. Scripts can help you boost performance and simplify your application.

#### Geospatial support

Redis has purpose-built commands for working with real-time [geospatial data](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-elasticache-utilizing-redis-geospatial-capabilities/) at scale. You can perform operations like finding the distance between two elements (for example people or places) and finding all elements within a given distance of a point.
