Hyperlinked to the text “Your e-receipt is available here” in an email the rental car company sent me. 
How would this system be architected? What are the various components, databases, control flow, data flow

The system behind this e-receipt retrieval link likely consists of multiple components working together to generate, store, and serve receipts securely. Here’s a breakdown of how such a system might be architected:

1. System Components
Frontend (User Interface)

• Email System: Sends the e-receipt email with a unique link.

• Web Application: A public-facing portal (e.g., budget.com) where users retrieve e-receipts.

Backend Services

• Receipt Generation Service: Generates a receipt upon transaction completion.

• E-Receipt API: Handles user requests and retrieves receipts based on the provided key.

• Authentication & Authorization: Ensures only authorized users can access receipts.

• Logging & Monitoring: Tracks access attempts and logs errors for security and troubleshooting.

Databases & Storage

• Transactional Database (SQL/NoSQL): Stores rental transactions and receipt metadata.

• Document Storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage): Stores PDF versions of receipts.

• Key-Value Store (e.g., Redis): Caches recent receipt requests for quick retrieval.

  

Security & Access Controls

• HMAC-Signed URL/Token System: Generates unique, time-limited links for security.

• TLS Encryption: Ensures data is transmitted securely.

• Rate Limiting & IP Filtering: Prevents abuse and unauthorized access.

2. Control Flow & Data Flow
Step 1: Receipt Generation

3. User completes a rental transaction → triggers receipt generation.

4. The Receipt Generation Service creates a PDF receipt and stores it in Document Storage.

5. Metadata (e.g., user ID, rental ID, receipt URL, expiration timestamp) is stored in a Transactional Database.

Step 2: Email Notification

4. The system generates a unique URL (e.g., retrieveEreceipt.ex?KEY=<token>).

5. The email system sends the URL to the customer.
  

Step 3: Receipt Retrieval

6. The customer clicks the link (retrieveEreceipt.ex?KEY=...).

7. The E-Receipt API receives the request and validates the key (HMAC signature, expiration).

8. If valid, it fetches the receipt metadata from the database and retrieves the PDF from Document Storage.

9. The receipt is displayed or downloaded.

  

Step 4: Security & Monitoring

10. Logs the access attempt for auditing.

11. Rate-limiting prevents abuse.

  

  

  

3. Additional Considerations

• Security: Use short-lived signed URLs to prevent unauthorized access.

• Scalability: Cache frequent requests (e.g., recent rentals) using Redis.

• Error Handling: If the link is expired, the system can prompt the user to log in and regenerate it.

  

This setup ensures secure, scalable, and efficient e-receipt retrieval.
