#data-warehouse


A data warehouse is a large, centralized repository of structured and historical data used for reporting, analysis, and decision-making purposes within an organization. It collects, stores, and manages data from various sources, such as transactional databases, external data sources, and application systems, and organizes it in a way that facilitates efficient querying and reporting.

Data warehouses are designed to support the efficient retrieval and analysis of large volumes of data, enabling organizations to gain insights and make data-driven decisions. They typically store data in a highly structured format, often using a schema design, such as the star or snowflake schema, to optimize query performance.
