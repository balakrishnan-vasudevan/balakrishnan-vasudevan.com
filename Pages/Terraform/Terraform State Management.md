### The Act: An IaC Developer’s First Terraform Commit

1. **Commit & Push**
2. **Terraform CLI Execution**
3. **Plan Output**

---

### The State Decision Gate: “Shall I?”

Before any action is taken, the developer (or CI/CD system) makes a conscious decision:

- If **NO**, the process halts—no changes are made.
- If **YES**, Terraform proceeds with the terraform apply command.

---

### Behind the Scenes: Terraform Apply & State Transition

When apply is confirmed:

1. **API Interactions**
2. **Terraform State Update**
3. **Remote State Management**

---

### Result: Synchronized Desired and Actual State

By the end of the flow:

- A new EC2 instance exists.
- The state file (Statefile V1) reflects this addition.
- It is safely stored in a remote backend for future collaboration, drift detection, and disaster recovery.

### Why This Matters for Tech Teams

For **technical professionals**, understanding Terraform’s internal state flow ensures more reliable infrastructure deployments and fewer surprises during CI/CD pipeline executions.
