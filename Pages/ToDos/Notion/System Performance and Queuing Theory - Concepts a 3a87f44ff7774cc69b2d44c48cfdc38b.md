Abstract:

What is queueing theory and how does it help us understand how software systems perform? This talk will go over the basics of queueing theory and how it can apply to software systems. It will then go into some intuition that we can get from the math about how we can expect our systems to perform in different configurations. Finally, it will go through some examples of how to use this information with real-world data and metrics. Attendees should leave the talk with some understanding of how to configure systems in the real world and how to understand when those systems are approaching a breaking point.
