Abstract:

We can only improve on things we introspect on. We often say that we want to build resilient socio-technical systems, ones in which the human operators are able to respond and adapt to unexpected failure modes, so how do we develop this resilience?

In this session we'll look at common, everyday tasks we all participate in to build resilience within our organizations without even realizing it. Coupled with research from many other areas outside of technology, we can continue to grow our ability to develop deep resilience in preparation for the unexpected incidents just around the corner.
