1. EC2 Instance Frequency - By default, EC2 provides basic monitoring, which tracks metrics every 5 minutes. For Auto Scaling based on EC2 metrics, it is recommended to enable detailed monitoring, which updates metrics every minute. Note this incurs an additional charge.
2. Auto Scaling Group Health Check - Make sure that the health check feature is configured correctly to detect that EC2 instances registered with an auto scaling group are functioning normally. Otherwise an auto scaling group cannot perform basic functions like removing and replacing failed instances.
3. Predictive Scaling Forecast - If you donâ€™t have any other monitoring mechanism for auto scaling, make sure your auto scaling group is configured to send email notifications upon scale out or scale in events. When notifications are enabled, an AWS SNS topic associated with the auto scaling group receives scaling events and sends notifications of scaling events to the email address you specified during the setup process.
