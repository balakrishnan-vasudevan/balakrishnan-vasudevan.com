## A resilient workload has the capability to recover when stressed by load (more requests for service), attacks (either accidental through a bug, or deliberate through intention), and failure of any component in the workload's components.

A resilient [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") not only recovers, but recovers in an amount of time that is desired. This is often called a recovery time objective (RTO). Within a [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value."), there is often a desire to not degrade, but to be capable of servicing the [workload](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.")'s requests during the recovery of a [component](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.component.en.html "The code, configuration and AWS Resources that deliver against a business requirement."). The study and practice of this implementation is known as Recovery Oriented Computing.
