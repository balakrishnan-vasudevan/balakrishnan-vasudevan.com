      <description>As we step into a new year, many of us set personal goals to delve deeper into various domains of knowledge. For me, one such aspiration revolves around enhancing my comprehension of distributed systems. In this pursuit, I&amp;rsquo;ve curated a list of seminal papers spanning various facets of distributed systems, intending to dissect, analyze, and learn from them.
While there exists an abundance of resources on distributed systems—ranging from blog posts to podcasts and videos—I aim to contribute to this reservoir by documenting my journey through these papers.</description>

      <description>In one of my previous roles at a leading cloud-based company, I encountered a fascinating challenge that underscored the importance of resource management in Kubernetes. While I can&amp;rsquo;t reveal specific company details, I&amp;rsquo;ll share a fictionalized account of an incident that carries valuable lessons for anyone navigating the complexities of scaling in a Kubernetes environment.

      <description>I came across this amazing video from Dave McAllister in the &amp;ldquo;WTF is SRE 2023&amp;rdquo; conference on the statistics behind the alerts.
Thanks to Dave for his clear explanation of the various concepts.
Here are my notes on the video:
Mean vs Median vs Mode - Mean = Measure of central tendency, the average value Median - In a sorted data set, median is the middle value Mode - Mode is the frequently used value in a dataset Arithmetic mean - Not the 50% mark.</description>

      <description>I resigned from my role at Salesforce in September of 2023 and have been interviewing with multiple companies for SRE/DevOps/Platform Engineering roles. I was offered an SRE role with Rad AI and I have accepted it and will be joining them in the last week of January. I am glad that I was finally able to get an offer and I am excited to be exploring site reliability for a medical AI product.</description>

      <description>I did a virtual onsite interview with Google for the Systems SRE role in 2022. This post is about my preparation for the interview and my actual interview experience.
In my previous post, I discussed the phone screen I had for the SRE role. After the phone screen, my recruiter got in touch with me, discussed the results of the interview and handed me over to another recruiter who handled the onsite interviews.</description>

      <title>Google tech screen - Systems SRE role</title>

      <description>I had my phone screen with a member of the Google SRE team last week. As I mentioned in my previous post, I am interviewing with Google for the Systems SRE role. I was nervous about the interview, given that I had failed this round in my two previous attempts. The interview covers practical coding and scripting and Linux fundamentals/trivia. The best part about being considered for the systems SRE role is that you will not be asked complex algorithmic questions.</description>

      <description>I am interviewing for the Systems SRE role with Google (Alphabet) in about 2 days. The SRE team at Google is something that I have looked up to ever since I read the first SRE book. I have tried interviewing for the role twice previously and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to go past the phone screen both the times. Hoping that the third time will be the charm!
Google pioneered the concept of Site Reliability Engineering, which is an amalgamation of systems engineering, coding and scripting, and networking functions.</description>

      <title>What a year!</title>

      <description>I grew up in the southern part of India and one of the things I loved doing the most at the end of the year was reading through the year-end summaries that the newspaper &amp;ldquo;The Hindu&amp;rdquo; published. It was a summary of the important events for every day of the year with some articles written by the top newsmakers of the year. This blog post is my attempt to do the same about how I did during 2021.</description>

      <title>The ever growing to-do list</title>

      <description>I set goals for how I want to grow my technical skills every year that I have been employed and fall short. 2021 was a similar year too. I set goals and fell short, by more than a mile.
So, what did I plan to learn this year? I wanted to get better with my Kubernetes knowledge and clear the CKA certification. How did I fare? I did learn a lot about Kubernetes as part of my job and my oncall duties, but I was not able to take the certification and had to cancel the registration for the exam.</description>
