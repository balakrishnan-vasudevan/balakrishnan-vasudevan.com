        <p>I have loved reading books ever since I was a kid. Both my parents had been avid readers all through their formative years and they used to gift me with books every time I scored good grades in school. I moved to a bigger school in sixth grade and as luck would have it, my principal was a voracious reader who made sure to stock up the library with an amazing collection of books on various subjects. I would race through my lunch and run to the library to spend the rest of my 30-minute lunch hour reading.</p>
<p>As I got older, I noticed that I have not been able to read with the same intensity that I had in my childhood. I feel that it is a combination of two factors - the amount of time in my day available to read and distractions - especially involving mobile phones. I have amassed a decent collection of books - hard copies, Kindle editiions, and audiobooks over the years. I love reading books on history and fiction novels dealing with espionage or war or geopolitics.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I have set a target for myself to read 26 books in a year. Why 26? 26 books a year is equivalent to reading a book every two weeks, which in my opinion, is a decent amount of time to spend reading. I started keeping track of the books I was reading in 2017. I hate it when people make pencil/pen marks in their books and I avoid doing the same. I do not have extensive notes on the books I read, but I do highlight my books in Kindle copiously and use Readwise to export these highlights to Notion.</p>
<p>I also listen to a lot of audiobooks. An Audible subscription gives you one book credit every month and I use it judiciously. One thing that helps with this habit is the driving involved to pick up/drop off my wife to/from her work. Also, I listen a lot during long roadtrips after my wife falls asleep in the car.</p>
<p>I have not been able to meet the 26-book goal since I started tracking the books I was reading. Here are the stats,</p>
<p>2017 - 9 books <br>
2018 - 3 books <br>
2019 - 22 books <br>
2020 - 12 books <br>
2021 - 2 books <br>
2022 - 3 books <br>
2023 - 12 books</p>
<p>This number includes both technical and non-technical books. 2024 was the year that I was able to meet the target. As of today, I have read 26 books so far, meeting my goals with 2 more months to go before the end of the year. I&rsquo;m sure that I will be able to read more than 30 books by December.</p>
