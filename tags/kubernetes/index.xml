      <description>Recently, I worked on resizing a statefulset. One of our workloads was constantly restarting due to the disk space filling up. The process of resizing the persistent volume of a statefulset is straightforward. You scale down the statefulset, modify the size of the underlying PVC, and then scale up the statefulset however, in this case, there were multiple complications and constraints. To begin with, our PVCs were configured to be deleted when they were not bound to any pod.</description>

      <description>One of the goals I set for myself for this year was to clear the Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification offered by CNCF. I have been working on Kubernetes since 2019. At Salesforce, I had the opportunity to work on managing more than 400 EKS clusters and control and data plane components in over 20 datacenters spread all over the world. I consider myself to be adept at troubleshooting issues with Kuberentes, but I wanted to get this certification in order to prove to myself that I understood the various concepts related to the operation of a Kuberentes cluster.</description>

      <description>Note: The following is a recount of an incident that occurred during my time as an SRE with a previous company. I do not have access to the original outage report and I am sharing this story based on my recollection. While I may not remember every detail with complete accuracy, the general sequence of events is described here to the best of my ability. Any errors or omissions are entirely my own.</description>
