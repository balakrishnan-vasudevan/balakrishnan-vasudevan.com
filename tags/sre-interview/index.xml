      <description>I resigned from my role at Salesforce in September of 2023 and have been interviewing with multiple companies for SRE/DevOps/Platform Engineering roles. I was offered an SRE role with Rad AI and I have accepted it and will be joining them in the last week of January. I am glad that I was finally able to get an offer and I am excited to be exploring site reliability for a medical AI product.</description>
