      <description>Note: The following is a recount of an incident that occurred during my time as an SRE with a previous company. I do not have access to the original outage report and I am sharing this story based on my recollection. While I may not remember every detail with complete accuracy, the general sequence of events is described here to the best of my ability. Any errors or omissions are entirely my own.</description>

This is where Distributed Tracing comes in, offering a powerful tool to illuminate the inner workings of your complex software systems.
Why is Tracing Essential? Link to heading Imagine a user journey through your application. They click a button, data flows across various services, and finally, a response appears on their screen.</description>

      <description>As we step into a new year, many of us set personal goals to delve deeper into various domains of knowledge. For me, one such aspiration revolves around enhancing my comprehension of distributed systems. In this pursuit, I&amp;rsquo;ve curated a list of seminal papers spanning various facets of distributed systems, intending to dissect, analyze, and learn from them.
While there exists an abundance of resources on distributed systems—ranging from blog posts to podcasts and videos—I aim to contribute to this reservoir by documenting my journey through these papers.</description>

      <description>In the ever-evolving landscape of job interviews, especially in the tech industry, there&amp;rsquo;s a trend that persists like an unwelcome guest at a party: the grueling interrogation of command-line knowledge. Picture this: you&amp;rsquo;re in a virtual interview, sweating bullets as the interviewer fires off questions about obscure commands or demands you regurgitate the contents of some long-forgotten system file. It&amp;rsquo;s the stuff of nightmares for many candidates, and frankly, it&amp;rsquo;s time we reassess its validity.</description>

      <description>I came across this amazing video from Dave McAllister in the &amp;ldquo;WTF is SRE 2023&amp;rdquo; conference on the statistics behind the alerts.
Thanks to Dave for his clear explanation of the various concepts.
Here are my notes on the video:
Mean vs Median vs Mode - Mean = Measure of central tendency, the average value Median - In a sorted data set, median is the middle value Mode - Mode is the frequently used value in a dataset Arithmetic mean - Not the 50% mark.</description>

      <description>I resigned from my role at Salesforce in September of 2023 and have been interviewing with multiple companies for SRE/DevOps/Platform Engineering roles. I was offered an SRE role with Rad AI and I have accepted it and will be joining them in the last week of January. I am glad that I was finally able to get an offer and I am excited to be exploring site reliability for a medical AI product.</description>

      <description>I did a virtual onsite interview with Google for the Systems SRE role in 2022. This post is about my preparation for the interview and my actual interview experience.
In my previous post, I discussed the phone screen I had for the SRE role. After the phone screen, my recruiter got in touch with me, discussed the results of the interview and handed me over to another recruiter who handled the onsite interviews.</description>

      <title>Google tech screen - Systems SRE role</title>

      <description>I had my phone screen with a member of the Google SRE team last week. As I mentioned in my previous post, I am interviewing with Google for the Systems SRE role. I was nervous about the interview, given that I had failed this round in my two previous attempts. The interview covers practical coding and scripting and Linux fundamentals/trivia. The best part about being considered for the systems SRE role is that you will not be asked complex algorithmic questions.</description>

      <title>2 days before a Google interview</title>
      <link>http://www.bala-krishnan.com/posts/3-google-sre-interview/</link>

      <description>I am interviewing for the Systems SRE role with Google (Alphabet) in about 2 days. The SRE team at Google is something that I have looked up to ever since I read the first SRE book. I have tried interviewing for the role twice previously and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to go past the phone screen both the times. Hoping that the third time will be the charm!
Google pioneered the concept of Site Reliability Engineering, which is an amalgamation of systems engineering, coding and scripting, and networking functions.</description>
