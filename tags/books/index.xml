      <description>I have loved reading books ever since I was a kid. Both my parents had been avid readers all through their formative years and they used to gift me with books every time I scored good grades in school. I moved to a bigger school in sixth grade and as luck would have it, my principal was a voracious reader who made sure to stock up the library with an amazing collection of books on various subjects.</description>

      <description>I set goals for how I want to grow my technical skills every year that I have been employed and fall short. 2021 was a similar year too. I set goals and fell short, by more than a mile.
So, what did I plan to learn this year? I wanted to get better with my Kubernetes knowledge and clear the CKA certification. How did I fare? I did learn a lot about Kubernetes as part of my job and my oncall duties, but I was not able to take the certification and had to cancel the registration for the exam.</description>
