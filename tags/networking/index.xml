      <description>Note: The following is a recount of an incident that occurred during my time as an SRE with a previous company. I do not have access to the original outage report and I am sharing this story based on my recollection. While I may not remember every detail with complete accuracy, the general sequence of events is described here to the best of my ability. Any errors or omissions are entirely my own.</description>
