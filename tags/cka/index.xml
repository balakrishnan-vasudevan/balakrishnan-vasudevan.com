      <description>One of the goals I set for myself for this year was to clear the Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification offered by CNCF. I have been working on Kubernetes since 2019. At Salesforce, I had the opportunity to work on managing more than 400 EKS clusters and control and data plane components in over 20 datacenters spread all over the world. I consider myself to be adept at troubleshooting issues with Kuberentes, but I wanted to get this certification in order to prove to myself that I understood the various concepts related to the operation of a Kuberentes cluster.</description>
