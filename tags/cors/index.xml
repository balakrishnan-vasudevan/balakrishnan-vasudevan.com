      <description>In the past few months, I have been working on migrating microservices hosted in Azureâ€™s CSP to the EA platform. Some of the changes my team has been making to the microservice manifests include standardizing naming, adding resiliency, improving observability, and hardening security by widely using sealed secrets. We use the Istio Service Mesh to provide a network overlay for managing traffic, security, observability, and more for our services. We use Istio to control outbound access to services from our cluster, add detailed tracing and metrics data to our observability stack, and provide routing and TLS customization for a variety of workloads.</description>
