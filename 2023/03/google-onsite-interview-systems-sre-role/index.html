				<p>I did a virtual onsite interview with Google for the Systems SRE role in 2022. This post is about my preparation for the interview and my actual interview experience.
In my previous post, I discussed the phone screen I had for the SRE role. After the phone screen, my recruiter got in touch with me, discussed the results of the interview and handed me over to another recruiter who handled these onsite interviews. I had a call with this new recruiter and we discussed the timeline and the topics I needed to prepare for.
Compared to the software engineer roles at Google, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of resources available online to help with preparation for the Google systems SRE role. I found these posts to be really useful:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://danrl.com/srm/">Dan Luedtke&rsquo;s blogpost on interviewing for the SRE manager role</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fabrizio2210.medium.com/how-i-get-a-job-at-google-as-sre-83d44aef7859">Fabrizio Waldner&rsquo;s post</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@oguzy/yet-another-blog-post-after-google-on-site-interview-b7d351aad844">Oğuz Yarımtepe&rsquo;s post</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The Systems SRE interviews have the following components:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions">Blind 75</a> list is a big help. I would also recommend practicing coding to recreate common systems functions like file traversal or log processing or file parsing. Again, writing memory efficient code is key. If you are asked to parse a log file, do not load your entire file to memory. Use techniques like sliding window to optimize reading sections of the file.</p>
<p>During my interview, I was asked to write a system function using Python. I used the file object as an iterator to avoid loading the entire file into memory, but the interviewer felt that I could use the sliding window technique to read as much of the contents of the file that I wanted.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For preparation, I used the following for basics:</p>
<ol>
<li>[System Design Primer] (<a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF">System Design Interview – An insider&rsquo;s guide</a> by Alex Xu
There are also multiple YouTube videos dedicated to the basic components of a modern production system, scalability, and reliability.
In addition to these resources and specifically for the Google NALSD interview, I recommend the following resources:</li>
<li><a href="https://sre.google/classroom/">SRE Classroom</a> - Go through both the exercises and the video lessons.</li>
<li>The slides for the presentation on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jW2S9yYZf5DYmri0KlOu1DFSZMTeOswl6ce5V9xMIOQ/edit?resourcekey=0-hzg8gPkGgiOc6HbBqalmWg#slide=id.p">Distributed Image Server</a> in the SRE classroom. I found this presentation to be very useful in that it showed me a sample of the BOM calculations.</li>
<li>Reading lists like <a href="https://github.com/dastergon/awesome-sre#reliability">this</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I felt like I did a good job with the estimations for storage, traffic, and amount of servers, but I made some mistakes with my system design by adding a single point of failure.
As with any other skill, practice is the key to acing this interview. Take your time, understand the basics, learn to make quick bakc-of-the-envelope estimations, and make sure to think about all of the failure modes of the system you are designing.</p>

<p>I have been in awe of the SRE team at Google ever since I read the Google SRE book. This was my third attempt at interviewing with Google and the first time I made it to the onsite rounds. The experience was great, the recruiters and schedulers are very friendly and the interviewers are very professional and proud of their work. The phase of life related to preparation and the interviews were a good learning experience. I hope to get another shot at the interview and this time, I hope to prepare better, learn from the mistakes I made in the past, and clear the interviews the next time.</p>
